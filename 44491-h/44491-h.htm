<h2><br /><br />TO THE SHOPKEEPERS OF GREAT BRITAIN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;As it is customary
for most men about this season of the
year, when accounts are balanced and
squared, to take a serious survey of
the posture of their affairs, and to
examine into their business prospects,
perhaps you may not consider a few
observations, touching the welfare
and position of that important class
of the community to which you belong,
either impertinent or ill-timed.
You are aware that, for the last year
or two, Her Majesty's Ministers have
been in the habit of opening Parliament
with a congratulatory assurance
of the continued, and even augmented,
prosperity of the country. The
reason why such statements were
made, altogether irrespective of their
truth or falsehood, is obvious enough.
In a political point of view, they
were necessary for the vindication of
the measures which Government
either originated or adopted. To have
admitted that the country was not
prospering under the new commercial
system, would have been considered
by the public as tantamount to an
acknowledgment that the policy which
dictated those measures was vicious;
and that the Whig ministry, if not
deficient in duty, had at least erred
sorely in judgment. In private life,
we rarely meet with that degree of
candour which amounts to an unequivocal
admission of error in point of
judgment&mdash;in public life, such an
admission is altogether unknown.
Failure may indeed be acknowledged
when the fact becomes too evident to
admit of further denial; but the
causes of that failure are never
attributed to their real source. Not
only the purity of the motive, but the
wisdom of the conception, is vindicated
to the last. In this case, however,
failure is totally denied. So far
from being put upon their defence,
the Whigs maintain that they have
achieved a triumph. Their averment
is, that, with the exception of the
agricultural producers, among whom
they allow that a certain degree of
distress prevails, all other classes of
the community are prosperous. Even
for the agriculturists there is balm in
store. The prosperity of the other
classes is to react upon them; so
that, within some indefinite period of
time, we shall all find ourselves in
circumstances of ease and comfort
which have hitherto been unknown in
our land.</p>

<p>With you the benefit is represented,
not as prospective, but as present.
The agriculturist may have to wait a
little longer, but you are already provided
for. Your cake is baked; and
we are assured that you are eating it
in thankfulness and joy. If this is
really the case, there is no more to be
said on the subject. If the harvest
of Free Trade has actually yielded
you such a large measure of profit, it
would be madness in anyone to decry
that line of policy in your hearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
You constitute the class which, from
its peculiar position and vocation, is
better qualified than any other to
judge accurately, and from experience,
of the degree of prosperity which is
actually known in the country. The
verdict of twelve shopkeepers, given
after an inspection of their books for
an average of years, ought to be of
more weight, in settling the merits of
any disputed commercial question,
than the random assurances of a
dozen cabinet ministers whose reputation
and official existence are bound
up in the vindication of their own
policy. The reason of this is perfectly
obvious. Your profit is simply
a commission upon your sales. You
do not produce or manufacture
articles of consumption&mdash;you simply
retail them. Your profit depends
upon the briskness of trade, that is,
the amount of demand. It rises or
falls according to the general circumstances
of your customers. In good
times you make large profits; in bad
times those profits decrease. One
while your stock sells off rapidly; at
another, it remains upon your hands.
Your interest is inseparable from that
of the great body of consumers by
whom you live. You have little or
nothing to do with the foreign trade;
for, whatever be the nature, of the
articles in which you deal, you sell
them in the home market. You have,
therefore, the best opportunity of
estimating the real condition of your
customers. The state of your own
books, and the comparative degree of
ease or difficulty which you experience
in the collection of your accounts,
furnish you with a sure index of the
purchasing power of the community.
Compared with this criterion, which
is common to every man among you,
tables of exports and imports, statements
of bank bullion, and such like
artificial implements as have been
invented by the political impostors
and economists, are absolutely worthless.
When our sapient Chancellor
of the Exchequer, or Mr Labouchere,
tell you, with an air of unbounded
triumph, that the exportation of
calicoes to China or Peru has mightily
increased&mdash;and therefore argue,
without condescending to inquire
whether such exportation has been
attended with any profit at all to the
manufacturers, that the prosperity of
the country is advancing at a railway
pace&mdash;you may indeed be gratified by
the statistical information, but you
will fail to discover in what way the
public are benefited thereby. It is
pleasant to know that there are fifteen
millions of gold in the vaults of
the Bank of England, and that, so
long as this hoard remains undiminished,
there is little chance of a commercial
crisis, or a violent contraction
of credit. But we take it you would
be infinitely better pleased to know
that sovereigns were circulating freely
from hand to hand amongst the people,
and that your customers had their
pockets so well filled as to enable
them to purchase largely, and to pay
their accounts when due. To you
any depression whatever is a serious
matter&mdash;a depression which assumes
a permanent appearance cannot be
much short of ruin. Therefore you
ought most especially to take care
that no false representation is made
regarding your circumstances, which
may be the means of perpetuating
a system that has already proved
detrimental to a large body of your
customers.</p>

<p>Were we to take for granted the
ministerial statement of prosperity&mdash;which
no doubt will be repeated next
February&mdash;your Whig minister being
an incorrigible cuckoo&mdash;this paper
would certainly not have been written.
But, having had occasion early
to doubt the truthfulness of this
vernal note, and having taken some
pains to examine the statements
which from time to time are issued
by the great houses engaged in commercial
and manufacturing industry,
as also the accounts of the present
condition of the poor, which have excited
so much public interest, we
have really been unable to discover
any one influential class, beyond the
money-lenders and creditors, or any
one large and important branch of
industry, which can, with truth, be
described as prospering, or will confess
to the existence of such prosperity.
Shipmasters, manufacturers,
merchants, iron-masters, and agriculturists,
all tell the same tale. This
is very strange. You may possibly
remember that Mr M'Gregor, once
Secretary to the Board of Trade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
now member for Glasgow, the great
commercial city of Scotland, estimated
the additional amount of wealth which
was to accrue to Great Britain, in
consequence of the repeal of the Corn
Laws, at two millions sterling per
week! Upon what data that profound
gentleman, who thus enunciated
the prophecy and assumed the
mask of Midas, proceeded in his calculation,
we know not, and perhaps
it would be superfluous to inquire. It
certainly was a good round sum; for,
by this time, without insisting upon
compound, or even simple interest, it
should have amounted to rather more
than one-half of the national debt;
but unfortunately nobody will own to
having fingered a farthing of the
money. In recalling to your memory
this little circumstance, it is by no
means our intention to offer any disrespect
to the intellectual powers of
M'Gregor, for whom, indeed, we entertain
a high degree of veneration,
similar to that which is manifested
by the Mussulman when he finds
himself in the company of a howling
derveesh. We merely wish to reproduce
to you one phantom of the
golden dream, which, five or six
years ago, when the fever of gain was
epidemical, possessed the slumbers of
so many; and having done so, to ask
you, now that the fever is gone,
whether it was not indeed a phantom?
We are wiser now&mdash;at all events, we
have had more experience&mdash;and the
producing classes tell us very distinctly,
and quite unanimously, that
they have derived no benefit whatever
from the commercial changes
which have taken place. Capital,
whether invested in ships, factories,
mines, or land, is less profitable, and
therefore less valuable, than it was
before; and in some instances, where
the depression has been most heavy,
it has been almost annihilated.</p>

<p>These are not our statements, but
the statements of the several interests,
as put forward by their own
representatives. They are statements
which emanate alike from the
Free-Trader and the Protectionist.
Men may differ as to the cause, but
they all agree as to the grand fact of
the depression. So that, when we
hear ministers congratulating themselves
and the country upon its general
prosperity, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i> with
this congratulation, find the accredited
organs of each of the great branches
of productive industry vehemently
asserting that they are exceptions
from the general rule, an anxious
believer in the probity of all parties
has his faith somewhat rudely shaken.</p>

<p>We believe that, collectively, you
are the best judges as to this disputed
matter. As the real wealth of
the country depends upon the amount
and value of its yearly produce&mdash;as
from that annual creation, when measured
by the monetary standard, and
circulated through a thousand channels,
all our incomes are derived&mdash;you,
who supply the whole population
with the necessaries and luxuries of
life, (fabricated by others, but passing
through your hands,) must necessarily
have the best means of
knowing whether the circumstances
of that population have, on the aggregate,
been bettered or made worse.
When Napoleon in the bitterness of
his heart declared that we were a
nation of shopkeepers, he uttered no
terms of reproach, though he intended
to convey a taunt. Your position
in the community is such that you
cannot flourish independent of its
general prosperity. The exporting
manufacturer, and even the foreign
merchant, may multiply their gains,
and realise fortunes, whilst other
classes, whose wellbeing is far more
important to the stability of the
empire, are hastening to decay. Such
phenomena are common in old states,
when the process of dissolution has
begun. The parasite lives and thrives,
while the tree round which it has
wound its tendrils is crumbling into
rottenness. But such is not your
case. Your interests are identical
with those of the productive classes,
for without them you could not exist.
Ill-remunerated labour&mdash;unproductive
capital&mdash;lessened means&mdash;deteriorated
property&mdash;are things which
affect you as deeply as though you
were the direct sufferers or losers.
Upon the wealth of your customers
depends your own. And therefore,
in such an important crisis as the
present, when the existing commercial
system of the country is vigorously
assailed by one party, and as
obstinately defended by another&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
facts and statements apparently
of much weight are adduced on either
side, to serve as arguments for the
overthrow or the maintenance of that
system&mdash;when some cite statistical
tables to prove that the country
must be prosperous, and others adduce
real evidence to show that the
reverse is the case&mdash;you cannot afford
to sit idly by, without throwing the
weight of your testimony and experience
into one or other of the scales.
You have had admirable opportunities
of noticing the working of the
Free-Trade system. It matters not
what were the original prepossessions
of any of you, or what might have
been your opinion with regard to the
merits of this or that scheme, while it
was still in embryo and untried. A
more complex question than that of
Free Trade, as affecting the importation
of corn, probably never was presented
to the public consideration.
Many excellent, judicious, and thoroughly
patriotic men, relying upon
the truth of statements which were
regarded by others as mere plausible
theories, were willing to submit to
the experiment. And when, by the
grossest act of political perfidy that
was ever perpetrated&mdash;an act which
future times, if not the present, will
stigmatise with deserved opprobrium&mdash;the
last and most important change,
save that which subsequently assailed
our maritime interest, was suddenly
effected, it was the declared opinion
of the majority that the new system
must at least have a trial, until its
real results were developed, and until
it became apparent to the nation
whether or not Free Trade would
operate for the advantage of the
people, as its advocates and promoters
had predicted.</p>

<p>Here we must, for a moment or
two, however unwillingly, digress.
The later measures of Free Trade
have assailed interests so important
and so strong, that its former and
earlier advances, stealthily and cautiously
made, have almost faded from
the public view. Free Trade, as a
political system, did not alone strike
at the agricultural or the shipping
interest. Since the days of Mr Huskisson,
who brought with him into
active life the principles which he
had imbibed in youth from his associates
in French Jacobinism, the
principles of Free Trade have been
gradually but cautiously applied to
various branches of British industry.
The slow and insidious nature of the
movement on the part of the statesmen,
who, even then, were yielding
to the influence of the modern economical
school, showed their distrust
of the system, which, if true, ought
at once to have been openly promulgated.
Like the late Sir Robert Peel,
Huskisson was destitute of that manly
courage which scorns concealment or
deceit, and walks steadfastly to its
goal. Cunning was an ingredient of
his nature: whatever he did was
accomplished by tortuous methods,
and vindicated upon false pretences.
The tendency of that policy which
he commenced was to maintain by
all means, at all hazards, and at the
sacrifice, if needful, of every other
interest, the manufacturing supremacy,
of England in the foreign
market&mdash;an object for which we still
are striving, though at the imminent
risk of the dismemberment of the
British empire. It is due, however, to
the memory of Mr Huskisson, to remark,
that, although the originator of
this policy, he does not seem to have
contemplated the extent to which it
would be carried out by his successors.
His opinions upon the subject
of protection to agriculture were
clear and decided: "There is no
effectual security, either in peace
or war, against the frequent return
of scarcity, but in making ourselves
independent of foreign supply. Let
the bread we eat be the produce of
corn grown among ourselves; and, for
one, I care not how cheap it is&mdash;the
cheaper the better. It is cheap now,
and I rejoice at it, because it is altogether
owing to a sufficiency of corn
of our own growth; but, to insure a
continuance of that cheapness, and that
sufficiency, we must insure to our own
growers <em>protection against foreign importation</em>,
which has produced those
blessings, and by which alone they can
be permanently maintained." The
time, however, was fast approaching
when the reins of government were to
fall into the hands of a scion of the
manufacturing body, in whose eyes
the momentary supremacy of party was
of more importance than any principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
of national policy. There is no
more curious page in history than
that which records the rise of British
manufactures towards the close of
last century. Invention after invention,
whereby manual labour was
superseded by machinery, and the
power of production almost indefinitely
multiplied, paved the way for
that monopoly which our manufacturers
enjoyed for at least a quarter
of a century, during which time every
other country in Europe except our
own was devastated by war, and the
peaceful arts forgotten or overthrown.
It was during that period that the
gigantic fortunes of the Arkwrights
and the Peels were made, and that
influence secured to the manufacturing
body in the British House of
Commons which it never possessed
before. But with the return of peace
the monopoly disappeared. By invention
in mechanical appliances,
Britain had the start of other
nations in the creation of manufactures;
by war, she was enabled
long to enjoy the undivided benefits.
But inventions are not the property
of a single nation; they pass from
one to another with the rapidity
of lightning; they are available
by the foreign, even more
easily than by the domestic, rival.
Hence it very soon became apparent
that other states were preparing to
compete with us in those branches
of industry which had proved so
exceedingly profitable. France, Belgium,
Germany, Russia, Switzerland,
and America, all entered keenly into
the contest; and then commenced
that decline of prices which has
continued, almost without intermission,
to the present hour. Reciprocity
treaties were tried, but were in
fact of little avail; for the great bulk
of the English exports consisted of
those very textile fabrics which it
was the object of each country to
produce for its own consumption,
if not to export to others. During
the war, both the expenses of government
and the interest of the
National Debt had doubled in amount,
and the monetary changes effected
in 1819 added at least one-third to
the weight of that augmented burden.
In order to make this taxation
bearable, the industry of the people
was protected in their own market
by a scale of customs duties, which
prevented the influx of foreign produce
at rates which must have
annihilated the British workman.
Protection is a clear necessity which
arises out of taxation. If the
tobacco, tea, coffee, sugar, beer, soap,
and other articles of the labourer's
consumption, are taxed in order to
maintain an expensive establishment,
and to defray the interest
of an enormous debt, he must have
a compensation of some kind. The
only kind of compensation which
can be granted, and which the wit
of man can devise, is to be found
in an equitable scale of duties, by
means of which all produce imported
into Britain shall be taxed as heavily
as though it had been reared, grown,
or made up on British ground by
British labourers. Unless this be
done, there is no fair competition.
The less burdened foreigner must
ultimately carry the day against
the heavily-taxed Englishman. And
when we consider that all taxes must
be paid out of produce, there being
no other source whatever from which
they can be drawn, the importance
of maintaining the market value of
our produce at a point equal to the
pressure of our taxation will at once
become apparent.</p>

<p>There are, however, plausible,
though in reality most fallacious
grounds, upon which the Protective
System may be assailed. In this,
as in every other country, the first
and most important branch of industry
is that which provides food
for the population. To that all
others are subordinate. It is impossible
to estimate the amount of
capital which has been laid out
upon the soil of Britain, first in
reclaiming it from a state of nature,
and, since then, in maturing and
increasing its fruitfulness. But some
idea may be formed of its magnitude
from the fact that, in 1846,
the annual agricultural produce of
the United Kingdom was valued,
according to the prices then current,
at £250,000,000. Whatever imperial
taxation is imposed on other
classes of the community is shared
equally by the agriculturists; and
they are, moreover, exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
heavy local rates, from which the
others are comparatively free. It is
a received maxim in political economy&mdash;we
ought rather to say a
rule of common sense&mdash;that all taxes
and charges paid by the producer,
over and above his necessary profit,
fail ultimately to be defrayed by
the consumer&mdash;that is, that such
taxes and charges form a component
part of the selling price of the article.
There is no specialty whatever in
the case of corn or provisions to
exempt them from the general rule.
But all restrictions which tend to
enhance the price of the first necessaries
of life are obnoxious to that
section of the people who, from
ignorance or incapacity, cannot understand
why bread should be dear
in one country and cheap in another.
They, too, are subjected to their
share of indirect taxation, and the
knowledge that they are so taxed
in the consumption of articles which
constitute their only luxuries, renders
them doubly impatient of a system
which, on the authority of wicked
and designing demagogues, they are
led to believe was invented by the
landlords solely for their own benefit.
Thus heavy taxation, however engendered,
must always be fraught
with great peril to the permanency
of a state. The burden of such
taxation falls most heavily upon
the land, and yet the agriculturist
is expected to provide food for the
people as cheaply as though he were
altogether exempt from the burden.</p>

<p>The reason why the exporting
manufacturers, and those politicians
who entered thoroughly into their
views, were so bent upon the destruction
of the Corn Laws, was twofold.
In the first place, the competition
in foreign markets threatened to
become so strong, owing to the rapid
development of textile industry on
the Continent, that it was necessary
to lower prices. England had given
machinery and models to the Continent,
and the Continent was now
fighting her with her own weapons,
and at a cheaper cost, as labour
abroad is less expensive than it is
here. In order to bring down the value
of labour in England, for the purpose
of protracting this grand manufacturing
contest, it was necessary to
lower, in some way or other, the
price of food in England, and this
could only be accomplished by free
admission of foreign supplies. In
short, their object was to bring down
wages. On this point we have the
testimony of Mr Muntz, M.P. for
Birmingham, as early as February
1842. He wrote as follows:&mdash;"Say
what you will, the <em>object</em> of the
measure is <em>to reduce wages</em>, and
the <em>intention</em> is to reduce them to
the Continental level. I repeat it,
the Corn Laws very materially support
labour in this country....
Why, the professed object of the
repeal is to enable the English merchant
to compete with the foreigner,
and how can he do that <em>unless by a
reduction of wages</em>, which reduction
will be upon all trade, home and
foreign?" Mr John Bright was not
less clear as to the necessity of
such reduction of wages in order to
maintain our exports: "If the tariff
in Russia imposed a heavy duty on
English yarn, and if English yarn
went there and had to be sold at
the same rate as the yarn of the
Russian spinner, he (that is, the
Russian spinner) not paying the
heavy duty, it followed that we
must, <em>by some means or other</em>, make
our goods cheaper by the amount
of duty which we paid, and to do
that <em>it was absolutely necessary that
the wages of the operatives in this
country should be reduced</em>." And Mr
Greg of Manchester, a leading member
of the Anti-Corn Law League,
wrote as follows:&mdash;"In the only
remaining item of the cost of production&mdash;that
is, the wages of labour&mdash;foreign
nations have a decided advantage;
and although a free trade in
provisions, by lowering them here,
and raising them abroad, might regulate
the difference, I doubt if it ever
could be entirely removed. Better
education, more sober habits, more
frugality, and general forethought,
together with cheaper food, will no
doubt enable our people to live in
much greater comfort than at present
<small>UPON CONSIDERABLY SMALLER
EARNINGS</small>." These extracts sufficiently
disclose the designs of the
Free-Traders against the wages of
the workman. In the second place,
it was believed by many of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
that, by sacrificing the agriculturists,
they would be able to turn the
attention of other countries, especially
America, from the prosecution
of their rising manufactures. They
argued, that if we were to surrender
and secure our provision market to
foreign states, they would return
the compliment by allowing us to
manufacture for them&mdash;in other
words, that the foreigners were to feed
England, and England was to clothe
the foreigners! This precious scheme
has since been avowed, seriously and
gravely, by men who have seats in
the present House of Commons; and,
so far as we can understand their
language, the philosophers of the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> consider this a
most sensible arrangement!</p>

<p>The agricultural interest, however,
was of too great magnitude to be
attacked at once. Several outworks
were to be gained before the citadel
was summoned to surrender. Accordingly
Mr Huskisson began, and
Sir Robert Peel continued, that system
of commercial relaxations, (which,
some five-and-twenty years ago, was
exposed and denounced in this Magazine,)
annihilating some branches of
industry and depressing others&mdash;pauperising
whole districts, as in the
Highlands, and merging the villages
in the towns&mdash;until the time seemed
ripe, and the opportunity propitious,
for the accomplishment of the grand
design. It is not now necessary to
dwell upon the circumstances which
attended the change in the Corn and
Navigation Laws&mdash;these are still fresh
in the memory of all of us, and will
not soon be forgotten. Our object
in this digression was simply to remind
you that Free Trade, in its
insidious and stealthy progress, has
warred with other interests than those
which belong to the agricultural and
the maritime classes.</p>

<p>Neither is it necessary at present
to advert to the gross inconsistencies
of the system&mdash;to the restrictions
which it still continues upon that
very branch of industry which it has
laid bare to foreign competition.
Let us take the system as it is, of
which you have had now nearly three
years' experience, dating from the
time when the ports were opened.</p>

<p>Three years constitute a long period
for the endurance of a commercial
experiment. During that time
you have had ample opportunity of
observing how the system has worked.
Are you richer or poorer than you
were before the experiment began?
If the former, Free Trade has worked
well; if the latter, it is a mischievous
delusion.</p>

<p>This is a question which you alone
can answer&mdash;or rather, every man
must answer it for himself. But this
much we may be allowed to say, that,
from what information we can gather
regarding the state of general trade&mdash;from
the sentiments which we have
heard expressed by many of the most
respectable of your own body&mdash;the
experiences of the last year have not
been such as to give you much encouragement
for the future. If it is so,
then you will do well to consider
whether or not you ought to lend that
great political influence which you undoubtedly
possess, in support of a
system which has not only failed to
realise the anticipations of its founders,
but has actually diminished in a
great degree the power of purchase of
the community.</p>

<p>This is no trivial matter to any of
us, least of all is it trivial to you. The
next general election will be, in its
results, by far the most important of
any which has taken place for centuries.
If, in the new Parliament,
all idea of a return to the Protective
System is abandoned, we may prepare
ourselves for that most dismal
conflict which can convulse a country&mdash;a
war against taxation, and ultimately
against property. For&mdash;rely
upon this&mdash;heavy taxation and cheap
produce are things which never can
be reconciled. You may, if you
please, hand over the home market of
Britain to the foreigner, and allow
him, without toll or custom, to supply
our wants with produce of his own
rearing; but, if you do so, what is to
become of our own population, and
their labour?&mdash;and how are you to
levy those taxes which labour alone
can supply? That manufacturing interest,
for which such desperate sacrifices
have been made, is daily losing
ground in the markets of the world.
The fact will brook no denial, and it
is admitted even by its own members.
America has refused the bait offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
to her by the Free-Traders, and is
engaged heart and soul in the cotton
manufacture, for which she possesses
within herself the command of the
raw material. <em>To those countries
which supply us with corn, our exports
of manufactures have alarmingly
decreased.</em> We may continue
to glut (for that is what we are
doing at present) the markets of India
and China, and our export tables
may exhibit a cheering increase in
the amount of yards of calico sent out;
but, unless the trade circulars are
utterly mendacious, the speculation
has been, and will continue to be for
a long tract of time, unprofitable.
The fact is, that the extent and value
of our foreign trade in manufactures
is little understood by most of us, and
grossly exaggerated by others. It
constitutes, after all, a mere fraction
of the national production. The consumption
of manufactures at home is,
or was, before the late changes were
made, twice as great as the whole
amount of our annual exports. The
prosperity of this country does not
depend upon the amount of wares
which it sends or forces abroad,
though that is the doctrine which is
constantly clamoured in our ears by
the political economists&mdash;a generation
of ridiculous pretenders, of whom it is
only necessary to know one, in order
to form an accurate estimate of the
mental capabilities of his tribe. It
depends on our own labour, on our
own internal arrangements, and on
that reciprocity between man and
man, and between class and class of
our fellow-subjects, which is the only
real security for the peace and tranquillity
of a kingdom. Those exporting
manufacturers, who rummage foreign
markets, are no better than so
many buccaneers. Their object is to
evade the burden of taxation at home,
and, wherever they can with advantage
to themselves, to bring in foreign
labour, untaxed and untolled, to supersede
that of the British workman.</p>

<p>You cannot have failed to remark
that the arguments which are now
put forward by the Free-Traders, in
support of their system, are totally
different from those which they advanced
while recommending it for the
adoption of the country. How often
were we told, during the struggle
which preceded the repeal of the
Corn Laws, that all the apprehensions
expressed of a permanent fall in the
value of produce, and of overwhelming
importations from abroad, were
purely visionary! Learned statists
undertook to prove by figures that
the whole quantity of grain which
could be brought into this country
was absolutely insignificant, and that
it could not disturb prices. Mr James
Wilson of the <cite>Economist</cite>, in his valuable
tractate entitled <cite>Influences of the
Corn Laws</cite>, which was published eleven
years ago, thus favoured the
public with <em>his</em> anticipations for the
future, in the event of the repeal of
the Corn Laws:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our belief is," says the sage of
Westbury, "that the whole of these
generally received opinions are erroneous;
that if we had had a free trade
in corn since 1815, the average price
of the whole period, actually received
by the British grower, would have
been higher than it has been; that
little or no more foreign grain would
have been imported; and that if, for
the next twenty years, the whole
protective system shall be abandoned,
<em>the average price of wheat will be
higher than it has been for the last
seven years</em>, (52s. 2d.,) or than it
would be in the future with a continuance
of the present system;&mdash;but
with this great difference, that prices
would be nearly uniform and unaltering
from year to year; that the disastrous
fluctuations would be greatly
avoided, which we have shown, in
the first proposition, to be so ruinous
under the present system."</p>

<p>For this very notable sentiment, Mr
Wilson was clapped on the back by
the Manchester men, and commended
thus in the seventh circular of the
League:&mdash;"We are much indebted to
Mr Ibbotson of Sheffield, <em>Mr James
Wilson</em>, and our esteemed correspondent,
for labouring to prove to the
landlords that they may safely do
justice to others, without endangering
their own interests. And we think
very much has been done towards
justifying their opinions, <em>that the money
price of grain would not be lowered
even by the total repeal of the Corn
Laws</em>!" Sir Robert Peel, in the memorable
debates of 1846, attempted to
justify his experiment on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
that previous commercial relaxations
had been found beneficial to the parties
who were directly engaged in the
trade, his inference being, that the
same result would follow in the case
of the agriculturists. Unfortunately
the data upon which he proceeded
were altogether fallacious; for, notwithstanding
his dexterity in selecting
figures, and bringing out balances
which were apparently favourable, it
was clearly demonstrated by Lord
George Bentinck, that in no one instance
whatever had those relaxations
proved favourable to the British
producer, and that many of them had
moreover occasioned a large loss to
the public revenue. But the language
held by Sir Robert Peel, upon that
occasion, cannot be construed otherwise
than as the expression of an
opinion that, by the repeal of the
Corn Laws, prices would not be materially
disturbed&mdash;at all events, that
they would not be lowered so as to
fall below the remunerative point.</p>

<p>The immense influx of foreign grain
which followed the opening of the
ports in 1849, and the immediate fall
of price, were calculated to alarm not
only the farmers, but even that section
of the Free-Traders who believed
conscientiously that the productive
powers of Europe and America were
unequal to the supply of so very considerable
a surplus. It is no wonder
that the farmers were frightened,
when they saw grain coming in at
the rate of a million of quarters per
month! They were, however, told by
the highest Free-trading authorities in
both Houses of Parliament, and the
same view was violently maintained
by the Liberal press, that their fears
were altogether groundless; that such
importations could not possibly be
maintained; and that the first inundation
was simply caused by an accumulation
of corn at the foreign ports,
stored up in readiness for the opening
of the English market&mdash;a contingency
which could not happen again. The
utmost pains were taken, by those who
had consented to the repeal of the Corn
Laws, to persuade the farmers that the
low prices of 1849 were attributable
principally to the superabundance of
the harvest at home; and they were
exhorted to wait patiently, but hopefully,
for the advent of better times.
In short, every means were taken to
persuade the agriculturists that they
were labouring under a temporary but
not a permanent difficulty, and that a
very short time would suffice to restore
them to their former condition.
But no one attempted to maintain, in
1849, that, if wheat continued to sell
at or about 40s. per quarter, its cultivation
could be profitable in Britain;
and when, at a later period, one or
two rash theorists attempted to broach
that doctrine, they were instantly put
to silence by the overwhelming nature
of the proof which was brought against
them&mdash;not the least instructive part of
it being the admissions of the leading
Free-Traders as to what really was, on
an average of years, the remunerative
price of wheat to the British grower.</p>

<p>It is now clearly established, that,
under Free Trade, 40s. per quarter is a
price which the British farmer cannot
calculate on receiving. The averages
of England are now about 36s. per
quarter, being 20s. lower than the
sum which Sir Robert Peel considered
as the lowest which could remunerate
the grower. Therefore, taking the
average yield of good wheat-land at
four quarters per acre, it appears that,
by continuing to grow that kind of
grain which is convertible into ordinary
bread, the farmer must be a
positive loser to the extent of <em>four
pounds per acre</em>! In other words,
even suppose no rent at all were taken
for the land, wheat cannot continue
to be grown at a profit in Great Britain,
so long as the averages remain
below 40s.; and we leave a large
margin to the credit of improved husbandry
and strict economy, exercised,
as it must be, at the expense of the
labourer's wages. That such is the
present condition of the British farmers&mdash;a
hopeless one, unless a legislative
remedy is applied&mdash;will brook
no denial. Last year we were told of
farms letting at an increase of rent,
and of other symptoms of agricultural
prosperity, whereof nothing now is
heard. The fact of the depression&mdash;if
we may use so mild a term in respect
to a branch of industry which is
now merely existing upon capital, not
by income&mdash;is beyond all possibility
of doubt or cavil. The causes of it
are obvious; and it now only remains
to be seen whether we can afford to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
allow agriculture to be extinguished
from among us, or at best raised to
that point which will afford a bare
subsistence to the grower, without
the risk of involving the rest of us
in a like calamity.</p>

<p>You may have heard it said&mdash;for it
has been often written&mdash;that it signifies
little to the people of this country
from what source they receive their
bread. It is worth your while to
examine into this. That a loaf baked
of American flour, grown in the valley
of the Mississippi, may taste quite as
well in the mouth of the consumer as
a loaf of English material is a circumstance
which we can readily believe;
but is this all that is to be considered?
Does the American bear any part of
our national taxation? Does he contribute,
directly or indirectly, to the
burdens which are common to the
British producer? Does he deal with
any of you, and can you call him a
customer? These are the questions
which you ought to ask yourselves,
in making up your minds on this
matter; and if you will only examine
the subject patiently and dispassionately,
your own common sense will
lead you to a just conclusion. Let
us suppose that all the food which
you purchase and consume was grown
on a foreign soil, and admitted free of
duty. You might then have cheap
bread, but, as a necessary consequence,
you would lose more than half your
customers. Unless people have money
they cannot buy; and if agricultural
production were to be abandoned in
the British islands, all those who derive
their incomes&mdash;not only directly,
but indirectly&mdash;from the soil, would
necessarily be stripped of their means.
Are you aware of the fact that, on a
minute analysis of the census of 1841,
it appeared that the relative numbers
of the population of Great Britain and
Ireland, supported and maintained by
the two great sources of production,
agriculture and manufactures, were
as 18,734,468, dependent on the first,
to 8,091,621, dependent on the second?
Do you believe that the country can
remain prosperous, if you strike a
deathblow at the produce which maintains
more than two-thirds of its
inhabitants?</p>

<p>Let us go a little farther, and suppose&mdash;what
may hereafter be the case&mdash;that
other countries could undersell
us in the home market in the article
of manufactures&mdash;that America,
France, or Germany could send us
cotton and woollen stuffs, and other
ware, cheaper than we could make
them at home. In that case, where
would be the sources of our income?
All industry would be prostrated&mdash;for
you know very well that a losing
trade will not and cannot be carried
on long, and that the time will soon
arrive when, through the failure of
capital, it must be abandoned. In
such an event, what would become of
our population, with their labour entirely
destroyed? How could the
taxes be levied, and the expenses of
government paid, to say nothing of
the interest of the National Debt?
Great cheapness you would have, no
doubt, but nobody would be able to
buy.</p>

<p>If cheapness is a blessing in food,
it is a blessing in clothing and in
everything else. The rule admits of
no exception. It is as advantageous
for any of us to save a pound on the
price of his coat as a penny on the price
of his loaf. Bread is, no doubt, the
most important article of the workingman's
consumption, but at the same
time it is no less a fact that the raising
of food is the most important part
of the production of the labouring-classes.
Without home labour, all
capital in this country would be annihilated,
or at least would depart
from it. Labour depends entirely
upon wages, and wages upon the
market price of the article produced.
If from the introduction of foreign
labour, in the shape of products, the
price of any article is forced down
below the cost of production, then
wages begin to fall, and in the end
production is extinguished. Why is
it that foreign countries have imposed
heavy duties upon our exported articles
of manufacture? Simply for this
object&mdash;that their own manufacturers,
who give employment to large numbers
of their population, may not be
undersold by ours, nor those means
of employment annihilated. In acting
thus, these governments perform a
paternal duty to the people&mdash;shielding
them against the competition of an
older manufacturing power, and preparing
them hereafter, when skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
capital are acquired, to enter neutral
markets, with a fair chance of ultimately
overcoming the other.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that, with an
equal degree of energy on the part of
its inhabitants, the country which is
the least heavily burdened must distance
others in all branches of industry,
where nature does not oppose
a barrier, or place it at a disadvantage.
The mineral wealth of England, and
our priority in manufacturing invention,
gave us for a long time an
advantage over all other nations.
America was not advanced enough to
enter into the lists of manufacturing
competition; the distracted state of the
Continent, and the perpetual presence
or apprehension of war, effectually
prevented the European states from
attempting to rival Britain. But since
that time vast changes have taken
place. The mineral resources of
other countries have been developed.
Some idea of the manufacturing
power which America now possesses
may be formed from the enormous
increase of her domestic production of
iron and coal. In 1829, the amount
of iron manufactured in the United
States was 90,000 tons; in 1848, it
had risen to 800,000 tons. The coal
raised in 1829 was 37,000 tons; in
1849 it was 3,200,000 tons. In the
article of cotton, which is our great
manufacturing staple, America has
the inestimable advantage of growing
the raw material&mdash;an advantage which
never can be counterbalanced, as,
even if we were to obtain our supplies
from some other quarter, the expenses
of freightage must still continue to
be great. In fact, to all appearance,
our supremacy in the conversion of
cotton is already doomed. That
branch of industry rests upon no substantial
basis. It rose like an exhalation,
and so it will disappear. These
are not merely our opinions, but those
of the most shrewd and calculating of
the Free-Traders. Hear Mr Greg of
Manchester on this subject, previous
to the repeal of the Corn Laws:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At present we are undersold by
foreigners in neutral markets in all the
staple articles of English manufacture.
In the articles of cotton, hosiery, and
cutlery, which amount altogether to three-fourths
of our exports, this is notoriously
the case. In cotton fabrics the Swiss
undersell us in several markets. In
cutlery Sheffeld is immensely undersold
by the Alsace, and our exports are yearly
decreasing. In hosiery, the case is still
worse. Saxon hosiery, after paying a
duty of 20 per cent, is sold in London
25 to 30 per cent cheaper than the produce
of the Leicester and Nottingham
looms. In Leicester the stocking frames
have diminished from 16,000 in 1815 to
14,000 in 1840; whilst in Saxony, in the
same time, they have increased from 4590
to 25,000. The English manufacturer
pays 2s. 6d. for the same work that the
French manufacturer gets done for 2½d.
The American cutlery market (the most
important of all) has been wrested from
us, and our exports of that article to all
the world have fallen from £1,620,000
in 1831 to £1,325,000 in 1841. <em>How far
with cheaper food, no taxes on the raw
material, and no duties but for the sake of
revenue, we might yet recover our lost
superiority, is a matter for grave consideration.</em>
I do not believe we could either in
woollens or hosiery; and even in the
cutlery or cotton trade I think it very
doubtful. Now, under a free commercial
system, the raw material would be nearly
the same in all countries, and the advantage,
where there was one, would be
generally on the side of foreigners.
France and Italy would have an advantage
in silk, and America in cotton; the
current expenses would also be nearly
equal. The machinery of foreign nations
even now is not very inferior to our
own, and is daily and rapidly improving;
their capital is fast accumulating, and
the yearly interest of it approximating to
our own rate."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, you see, is a confession of
opinion by a leading Free-Trader, that
even the cheapening of food, by which
he means the reduction of the wages
of labour, will not suffice ultimately to
secure us the supremacy of the foreign
markets. He is perfectly right.
In this insane, and we believe almost
entirely unprofitable competition with
the rest of the world, we must infallibly
be overcome. No cheapness
of food can countervail the pressure
of our heavy taxation. The cotton-lords,
if they could, would fain bring
down the price of labour to the Continental
level, which doubtless would
enable them, for a long time, to prolong
the contest; but this they cannot
do, if our national engagements are
to be fulfilled, and our most valuable
institutions maintained. So long as
the revenue duties exist, labour cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
be forced down to that point.
But, in the mean time, agriculture may
be ruined, and the home trade, by
which alone you subsist, be palsied.
In fact, the present struggle lies between
the home trade and the foreign
trade. One or other of these must
ultimately succumb. The effect of
our present commercial system is to
paralyse the home trade, by decreasing
the value of all kinds of domestic
produce; by lowering all incomes,
and consequently reducing the amount
of the internal business of the country.
It has enabled our manufacturers, for
the time, to make a show of larger
exports than before; but it has not,
according to their own acknowledgement,
at all enhanced their profits.
It may have enabled them to lower
their prices, but it has not increased
their returns.</p>

<p>And no wonder that it should be so.
Except in the most miserable and
unimportant quarters, our relaxations
have been met by augmented tariffs
instead of eager reciprocity. The
nations of the world have refused to
sacrifice their advantages, to renounce
their prospects, and to become Free-Traders
at the call of Britain. Their
statesmen thoroughly understood the
motive of the ingenuous offer: they
were not to be cozened even by the
plausibility of Sir Robert Peel. It is
almost melancholy now, when we remember
what has actually taken place,
to revert to the peroration of that
statesman's speech delivered on 16th
February 1846. A more lamentable
instance of delusion, as to the true
feeling and position of other countries,
was never perhaps exhibited. Mark
his words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many countries are watching with
anxiety the selection you may make.
Determine for 'Advance,' and it will be
the watchword which will animate and
encourage in every state the friends of
liberal commercial policy. Sardinia has
taken the lead. Naples is relaxing her
protective duties, and favouring British
produce. Prussia is shaken in her adherence
to restriction. The government
of France will be strengthened; and,
backed by the intelligence of the reflecting,
and by conviction of the real welfare
of the great body of the community, will
perhaps ultimately prevail over the self-interest
of the commercial and manufacturing
aristocracy which now predominates
in her Chambers. Can you doubt
that the United States will soon relax
her hostile tariff, and that the friends of
a freer commercial intercourse&mdash;the
friends of peace between the two countries&mdash;will
hail with satisfaction the example
of England?"</p></blockquote>

<p>How strangely did this remarkable
man, whose career in all time coming
will be a warning to the aspiring
statesman, misunderstand the true
nature of his country's position! In
order to tempt reciprocity he opened
the British ports&mdash;that is, he conceded
gratuitously the only condition
by which we ever could have hoped
to insure it! At the expense of the
British agriculturist he opened the
British market to the foreigner, in
the expectation, as he expressly declared,
that the boon would be repaid
by measures which would prevent
the rise of manufactures abroad, and
restrain other nations from employing
capital profitably, from entering into
rivalry with Britain, and from using
those natural advantages which were
ready to their hand; and which, if
used, could not fail to add to their
wealth, and to furnish employment
for millions of their increasing population!
Most egregious was the
blunder, and terrible is the penalty
which we are certain to pay for it, if
we do not retrace our steps.</p>

<p>It is always useful to know what
intelligent men of other countries
think of our system. They survey
and examine it without those prejudices
which are apt to beset all of us,
and are better able than ourselves to
determine with what degree of favour
it will be received, or is received, by
those who are removed beyond the
scope of our immediate observation.
Certainly, of all others, from their
affinity to ourselves, and their proverbially
shrewd acuteness in all
matters of commercial detail, the
Americans are most likely to form
an accurate estimate both of our position
and our prospects in regard to
foreign trade. It is well worth our
while to read and consider the following
opinion of Mr Carey, the most
distinguished Transatlantic writer on
points of political economy. It occurs
in his work entitled <cite>The Harmony
of Interests</cite>, published in America so
late as December 1849.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Men are everywhere flying from
British commerce, which everywhere
pursues them. Having exhausted the
people of the lower lands of India, it
follows them as they retreat towards the
fastnesses of the Himalaya. Affghanistan
is attempted, while Scinde and the
Punjaub are subjugated. Siamese provinces
are added to the empire of Free
Trade, and war and desolation are carried
into China, in order that the Chinese
may be compelled to pay for the
use of ships, instead of making looms.
The Irishman flies to Canada; but there
the system follows him, and he feels himself
insecure until within the Union.
The Englishman and the Scotchman try
Southern Africa, and thence they fly to
the more distant New Holland, Van Diemen's
Land, or New Zealand. The farther
they fly, the more they use ships and other
perishable machinery, the less steadily
can their efforts be applied, the less must
be the power of production, and the fewer
must be the equivalents to be exchanged;
and yet in the growth of ships caused by
such circumstances, we are told to look
for evidence of prosperous commerce!</p>

<p>"<em>The British system is built upon cheap
labour, by which is meant low-priced and
worthless labour.</em> Its effect is to cause it
to become from day to day more low-priced
and worthless; and thus <em>to destroy
production upon which commerce
must be based</em>. The object of protection
is to produce dear labour&mdash;that is, high-priced
and valuable labour, and its effect
is to cause it to increase in value from
day to day, and to increase the equivalents
to be exchanged, to the great increase
of commerce.</p>

<p>"The object of what is now called
Free Trade, is that of securing to the
people of England the further existence
of <em>the monopoly of machinery</em>, by aid of
which Ireland and India have been
ruined, and commerce prostrated. Protection
seeks <em>to break down this monopoly</em>,
and to cause the loom and the anvil to
take their natural places by the side of
the food and the cotton, that production
may be increased, and that commerce
may revive."</p></blockquote>

<p>In short, the harmony of interests
is regarded in America as the grand
point of aim for the statesman. With
us, our most important home interests,
on which depend the welfare of by
far the greater part of our population,
are sacrificed to prolong a struggle in
which our exporting manufacturers
cannot possibly be the victors, and
from which, even at present, they
derive little or no profit.</p>

<p>Now, let us ask you to consider for
one moment, what is the natural
effect, upon the whole of us, of a
forcible diminution of prices, and depreciation
of produce. Here we shall
borrow an illustration and argument
from our adversaries, referring to a
point which is in the recollection of
all of you, and about which there can
be no possible mistake. You will
recollect that the Liberal and Free-trading
journals, almost without exception,
as well as most of the defenders
of the Peel policy in the House
of Commons, attributed much of that
general depression and stagnation of
trade which followed the repeal of the
Corn Laws to the losses sustained by
the failure of the potato-crop in
1845-6. Was there a general want
of confidence visible&mdash;were the shopkeepers
scant of custom&mdash;was there a
less demand than usual within the
country for home manufactures&mdash;was
there a decline in the price of iron&mdash;all
was laid at the door of the unfortunate
potato. Since Cobbett uttered
his anathema against the root, it
never was in such bad odour. To
every complaint, remonstrance, or
lamentation, the reply was ready&mdash;"How
can we remedy a calamity of
this kind? The potato has done it
all!" At that time it was very convenient,
nay, absolutely necessary,
for the Free-Traders to discover some
tangible cause for the gross failure of
their predictions. They looked about
them in every direction, and they
could discover nothing except the
potato which could endure the blame.
Now, although we believe that this
esculent has been unduly reviled, and
made to bear a greater burden than
was its due for political misfortune,
we nevertheless accept the illustration
at the hands of our opponents,
and we beg you to mark its significance.
The loss of the potato-crop
in Great Britain and Ireland, during
the year in question, has been variously
estimated, but if we assume it
to have been £20,000,000 we are
making a very large calculation indeed.
So then, <em>according to the Free-Traders,
the loss of twenty millions of
agricultural produce</em> was sufficient to
bring down profits, embarrass trade,
and cause a stagnation in home
manufactures! And yet, when Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
Villiers came forward in the beginning
of 1850, and told you, in his
capacity of proposer of the Address
to the Crown, that £91,000,000
were <em>annually</em> taken from the value
of the agricultural produce of the
country, you were expected, and
directed, to clap your hands with
joy, and to congratulate one another
on this symptom of the national prosperity!</p>

<p>The sum of twenty millions lost by
the failure of the potato-crop&mdash;a single
event, not one of annual occurrence&mdash;was
taken from the country's power
of produce; and <em>therefore</em>, said the
Free-Traders, there was stagnation.
But they, of course, could not help it.
Of course they could not; but what
about the ninety-one millions of <em>annual</em>
loss, which is equally deducted from
the internal expenditure of the country?
About <em>that</em> we do not hear a
word. And yet ask yourselves, and that
most seriously&mdash;for it is time that we
should get rid of all such pitiful paltering&mdash;whether
there is any difference
whatever between the two
cases, except that the one was an
isolated casualty, and that the other
is an annual infliction to which we
are subjected by statute? Weigh the
matter as you will, you cannot, we
are satisfied, be able to detect any
difference. If the grower of grain at
present prices has no remuneration
for his toil, or return for his capital,
he cannot buy from you, any more
than could the farmer whose crop
perished by the potato disease. What
caused the stagnation? The failure
of the power to purchase, because
there was no return for produce.
What causes the stagnation? Precisely
the same thing perpetrated by
Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Do not, we beseech you, allow
yourselves to be fooled any longer by
the jesuitry of these political economists,
but apply your own reason to
discover the cause of the present depression.
Do not believe them when
they talk about exceptional causes,
affecting temporarily the industry
of the nation, but certain immediately
to disappear. If you were
to live as long as Methusaleh, no
one year would elapse without furnishing
those gentlemen with a special
and exceptional cause. One year
it is the potato disease; another
the French Revolution; another the
Great Exhibition. Heaven only
knows what will be their excuse next
year&mdash;perhaps the new Reform Bill,
or some other similar godsend. You
are the particular class upon whom
the deception is to be played, and for
whose especial benefit the fraud is
concocted. The producers know very
well how they stand, and what they
have to expect. They can be no
longer cajoled by assurances of higher
prices, by vague promises of profit
after the disappearance of "the transition
state," or by impudent averments
that, by an entire change of
system and the expenditure of more
capital, they will be able to maintain
themselves in affluence. To do the
Free-Traders justice, they have for
some time desisted from such attempts.
They now address their
victims, through their organs, in a
fine tone of desperado indifference,
telling them that, if they do not like
the present arrangement, the sooner
they go elsewhere the better. And
the people are taking them at their
word and going. Hundreds of thousands
of tax-payers are leaving the
country as fast as possible, carrying
with them the fragments of their property,
and bequeathing to those who
remain behind their share of the national
burdens. But in your case,
the Free-Traders cannot yet afford to
pull off the mask. They are apprehensive
that you should see them in
their real character; and therefore, so
long as you are likely to be amused
with "specialties" and "exceptional
causes," these will be furnished to
you gratis, and in great variety.
There seems, however, to be an apprehension
among their camp that
you are beginning to evince suspicion.
Recent elections have not been quite
as they should be; and in the seaport
and large commercial towns there
are evident symptoms of mutiny. So,
by way of diverting your attention,
you are likely to have a measure
of Reform next year, possibly as
satisfactory in its result as the Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill, upon which Ministers
cleverly managed to concentrate
the whole public attention
throughout last session, and then,
having carried it, allowed its provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
to become a dead letter,
almost before the ink, which made
the measure complete, was dry! We
say this, not as opponents of an
extension of the suffrage&mdash;for on that
point we reserve our opinion until
the details are fully before us&mdash;but
as enemies and loathers of a miserable
system of chicane and deception which
has now crept into the public counsels,
and which threatens very speedily
to destroy the independence of public
opinion, by opposing state obstacles
to its free and legitimate expression.
We ask any of you, fearlessly, to
look back at the records of last
session, and then say whether the
country was not degraded and stultified
by the act of the Prime Minister?
Right or wrong, at his invitation and
call, the Protestants of Great Britain
demanded a security against what
they considered an intolerable instance
of Romish insolence and aggression.
They received it from
Parliament; and the moment it
passed into the hands of the executive
power, it became as worthless as the
paper upon which it was written!
And why was this? Simply because
the object was gained&mdash;you had been
amused for a whole session. If nothing
was intended to be done in the
way of repelling aggression, and if
Ministers durst have told you so a
year ago, there were many points affecting
your more immediate interests
which would have been forced upon
their attention. But they were very
glad to escape from such discussions
under cover of a Protestantism which
they did not feel, and an affected
indignation of Papal claims, which
they had done everything in their
power, by diplomatic agency, to encourage;
and, having escaped the
perils of one session upon that ground,
they will strain every effort to turn
your attention from your own position,
during the next, by bringing forward
some measure which they hope may
enlist your sympathies, or provoke
controversy, so far as to render you
indifferent to the real nature of your
position. The selection of the battlefield
is the oldest trick in strategy.
Get up the appearance of a battle,
and people will flock from any distance
to witness it, regardless of their
own interest. Lord John Russell is
famous for bloodless fields, which
resolve themselves into reviews&mdash;shall
we have another such in the course of
the approaching session?</p>

<p>That manufactures are now exceedingly
depressed, and have been
so for a long time, notwithstanding
the reduction in the price of food
consequent upon foreign importations,
is an admitted and notorious fact.
We have from time to time kept this
before the public view by quoting
from the trade circulars; and though
further evidence may be unnecessary,
we shall subjoin extracts from the
last accounts received from three
seats of industry, two of which are
represented in Parliament by Colonel
Peyronnet Thompson and Mr Feargus
O'Connor. Gloomy as they are,
they are by no means the worst
which we have had occasion to cite
during the last two years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Bradford</span>, <em>November 6</em>.&mdash;The market
here does not show any symptom of improvement
in the demand for any kind of
combing wools. All seem in wonder and
anxiety as to what may be next expected,
for to buy none are willing, whether with
stock or without. The staplers appeared
to expect that the spirited buying of
colonial wools would give a tone of confidence,
but that appears to have no
effect. The spinners pause when they
contrast the comparative high prices of
English wool, especially those of the finer
class, with what they were in 1848, when
yarns were at the present prices, and will
not buy with the certainty of making so
great a loss as a purchase would entail.
The supply of Noils and Brokes was
never so limited as at present, and the
small quantity making brings full prices.
The business doing in yarns is certainly
small, and the transactions confined to
immediate delivery. No one seems inclined
to enter into engagements for
distant delivery. For to go on at the
present prices of yarns is worse than madness,
the price for low numbers of good
spinning and standing having reached 8s.
per gross, and those of a secondary class
sold, if reeled, for what may be the instructions
to the commission houses, who
have needy parties pressing sales. The
quantity so offering is not so great, but
the sacrifices which have now for so long
been made render the position of the
trade exceedingly embarrassing. <em>The
production continues to be daily curtailed,
and from the whole district the same cheerless
tidings are received. Some large
houses, who have never reduced their operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
before, have adopted it, their loss
being so immense, and the whole condition
of the trade so thoroughly disjointed.</em> In
pieces the business during the week has
not shown any feature of increased activity,
and the stocks in the manufacturers'
hands are somewhat increasing,
but not so fast as last year at this period,
and especially in Coburgs and fancy goods:
the former are chiefly made in this district,
and not in Lancashire, for the ruinous
price has driven them on to other
classes of goods adaptable to their looms;
and for some months several large houses
have been engaged in making Bareges
for the American market. This has prevented
mousselines-de-laine being made
to stock, and, perhaps for many years,
this branch of the trade has not opened
with so small a stock on hand.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>, <em>November 6</em>.&mdash;In lace
we have no improvement to notice this
week in the general sale of goods, and,
with very few exceptions, there is a great
falling off in demand; but, as many of
the manufacturers are wisely lessening
their production, we do not anticipate
any serious losses resulting from the present
temporary stagnation. Many are
stopping their frames to make fresh designs
altogether; which, if done with
good taste, some advantage may result
from present difficulties. In hosiery our
trade is not so much depressed as we had
reason to anticipate. There is still a fair
business doing in wrought hose, and a
little increased demand for 'cut-ups,' as
well as gloves made of thread and spun
silk. The price of yarn is low, which is
in favour both of the manufacturer and
merchant.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Leicester</span>, <em>November 6</em>.&mdash;The unsettled
state of the price of workmanship
for straight-down hose has caused a
great depression in that branch, and led
to nearly a total cessation of work, many
hosiers declining to give out until prices
are settled. In wrought hose a better
business is doing, though not so good as
usual at this season. Yarns continue
dull of sale."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, why do we insist upon these
things? For two reasons. In the
first place, we wish you to observe
that the cheapness of manufacturing
products does not of itself induce consumption.
There must be buyers as
well as sellers in order to constitute
a market, and the tendency of our
late legislation has been to diminish
the means of the former. It by no
means follows that, if we have cheap
food and cheap manufactures, the
relative position of all classes can be
maintained. Never forget <em>that our
burdens all the while remain at a fixed
money rate</em>, and that, as the value of
produce is lowered, the weight of
those burdens is aggravated. This
consideration, which is now well understood,
is beginning to tell strongly
against the doctrines of the Free-Traders,
even with some of those,
who were once their ardent supporters.
Mr James Harvey of Liverpool,
late a member of the Anti-Corn-Law
League, but now a strenuous
opponent of their system, thus chronicles
the leading cause of his conversion.
We quote from his pamphlet
just published, <em>Remunerative Price
the Desideratum, not Cheapness</em>. He
says:&mdash;"My suspicions were first
awakened by the blind devotion of
the Manchester school of political
economy to the doctrine of <small>CHEAPNESS</small>;
for it struck me as a self-evident
proposition, that to buy cheap
is to sell cheap, in which case there
can be no possible gain, but a positive
loss, arising from the necessary aggravation
of all fixed charges." In
order to place the producers of this
country in the same position as before,
it would be necessary to reduce all
fixed charges, the interest of debt
both public and private, the expenses
of government, and all salaries and
annuities, to an amount corresponding
to the forced decline of prices. This
would be called a war against property;
but, in reality, the war against
property began when the Legislature
admitted foreign untaxed produce to
compete with the produce and labour
of our tax-paying population at home.</p>

<p>Our second reason for drawing
your attention to the cheerless prospect
of manufactures, has reference
to the sacrifices, not only indirect
but direct, which the other classes of
the community were called upon to
make in order to prop them up. In the
first place, the Property and Income
Tax, which we are still called upon to
pay, was imposed by Sir Robert Peel
expressly for the object of effecting
"such an improvement in the <em>manufacturing
interests</em> as will react on
every other interest in the country."
He admitted that it was an unjust
and partial impost, and therefore
promised that it should be only temporary&mdash;however,
we have endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
it for ten years, and the Whigs will
no doubt make an effort to continue
it still longer. Here, then, you have
a sum of five millions and a half
annually confiscated for the benefit of
the manufacturers, who were relieved
from taxation to that amount. So
far for sacrifice the first. Then came
sacrifice the second, in the shape of
Free Trade, mulcting the productive
classes of this country to the extent
of at least five-and-thirty per cent of
their annual returns. Then came
sacrifice the third, which handed over
the carrying trade to the foreigner.</p>

<p>Now, considering that all these
sacrifices have been made for the
encouragement of manufactures, or at
least with that professed object, is it
not, to say the least of it, extraordinary
that they have not thriven?
How are we to account for a result
so wholly contrary to the avowed
anticipations of our statesmen? The
explanation is, after all, not very
difficult. All these sacrifices have
been made, not for the great body of
the manufacturers, but for a mere
section of them. We possess no
authentic official information as to the
amount of manufactures consumed at
home; but we have records, more or
less trustworthy, of the amount of
our exports, and these are used to
mislead the minds of the multitude as
to the actual extent and relative importance
of our trade. England has
no more title than France has to the
character of the workshop of the
world. We are driven from the
markets of civilised countries by the
protective duties imposed by their
governments for the righteous and
prudent purpose of fostering native
industry, and we are compelled to
seek our marts among people who
are not yet so far advanced in political
economy as to detect the enormous
discrepancy between our principles
and our practice. Listen to Mr Harvey's
sketch of our foreign trade:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From the theories and systems I
turned my attention to passing events
and recorded facts: I saw the West Indies
prostrated; Canada thrown into a
state of revolt, succeeded by a smothered
feeling of discontent; Ireland depopulated;
the magnificent resources of India
undeveloped; and the British farmer reduced
to the dire necessity of paying rent
out of capital. I also perceived that the
change in our commercial policy had substituted
a cosmopolitan cant in the place
of patriotism and nationality. To become
the friend of every country but his own
had become the pride and the glory of
statesmanship. Foreign goods were admitted,
duty free, into our ports, in the
vain hope of reciprocity being established;
but our manufactures were subjected
to heavy imposts on the Continent of
Europe, and in the United States. China,
unversed in the mysteries of political economy,
only levies five per cent upon our
goods, whilst, in direct contravention of
our pet notions of Free Trade and reciprocity,
we impose a tax of 300 per cent
upon her teas. <span class="smcap">Our hopes have been
disappointed, our calculations falsified.
We are the dupes of our own
fantastic ideas and Quixotic concessions.</span>
We are the laughing-stock of the
Old and the New Worlds. The Germanic
Zollverein shuns our overtures; the American
excludes our ships from his seaboard."</p></blockquote>

<p>Can these things be controverted?
We defy the ingenuity of mankind to
do it.</p>

<p>So much for the foreign trade; but
there still remains the home trade, in
which by far the largest portion of our
manufacturing capital is embarked,
and which furnishes a much greater
amount of employment to British
labour than the other. You see what
is the state of that trade, notwithstanding
the savings which may have
been effected by the lowered price
of food, and also notwithstanding
that partial protection which several
branches of it are still allowed to retain.
One word as to that incidental
point. Mr Cobden is reported to have
said, that he did not care how soon
these remnants of protection were
abolished. Let him be as good as his
word, and, <small>IF HE DARES</small>, rise up in his
place in the House of Commons, and
make a motion to that effect. We
shall then have an opportunity of
testing the exact nature of his principles.
To what cause can such a
depression as this, so long and continuous,
be attributed, except to a
general curtailment of demand on the
part of the consumers, arising from
the insufficiency of their means to make
purchases as before? You are probably
aware that what is called strict economy
in families is not favourable to
the interests of manufacture or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
trade. Of manufactures of all kinds
there must be a certain yearly consumption,
based upon the necessities
of the people. Besides food, men require
clothes to cover them, and
houses in which to dwell, and those
houses must be more or less furnished.
But between the bare supply
of such necessities, and that point
which is considered by persons,
according to their tastes, education,
or habits, as constituting comfort,
there is a wide interval. Nothing is
a more sure criterion of the wealth
and income of a people than the ordering
of their homes, and the manner
of their living; and the traveller who
passes from one country into another
can at once form an estimate, from
such appearances, of their respective
wealth or poverty. Diminish income,
and a reduction is immediately made.
All superfluities are lopped off and
renounced. The broker, who deals in
second-hand articles, drives a larger
business than the man who is the
vendor of new ones; and even in
domestic labour there is a large economy
practised, by reducing establishments.
That this must be so, will be
evident on the slightest reflection.
Reduce a man's income from £1000
to £800 or £600, and he will, if he
has any wisdom or prudence, cut
down his expenses to meet the fall.
It is upon the home manufacturer in
the first place, and upon the shopkeeper
secondly, that these reductions
tell. The one finds that his amount
of production is much greater than
the demand; the other does not turn
over his capital nearly so rapidly as
before. Add to this that the home
manufacturer, in many branches, is
exposed to strong foreign competition.
Sir Robert Peel, in his last alterations
of the tariff, did indeed continue Protection&mdash;more
largely than is generally
understood, for the mere amount
of revenue-duty drawn from importations
of foreign articles, adapted to
compete with ours in the home, is no
criterion of the Protective value&mdash;to
some branches of industry; but others
were exposed without shelter, and
have since suffered accordingly. It
is undeniable that a very large amount
of foreign manufactures, which have
paid no duty at all, or merely an
elusory one, are consumed within this
country&mdash;thereby inflicting extreme
injury upon British labour, and depressing
trades which, though severally
not important, give in the
aggregate, or ought to give, the
means of employment to thousands.
Regard the subject in any light you
will, this cheapness, of which we have
heard so much, just amounts to a
diminution of the income of every
class, except the annuitants and fund-holders,
while it consequently renders
the payment of the fixed burdens
more grievous to every one of us.</p>

<p>You, gentlemen, to whom we have
ventured to submit these remarks,
have a very great deal in your power.
You can, by your decision, either
confirm the present policy, or cause
it to be reversed; and your own
experience will suffice to show you in
what manner the system has worked.
Statists may parade their figures, economists
may puff their plans, statesmen
may indulge in high-coloured
pictures of the success which they expect
to follow their measures&mdash;but the
true test of every measure which has
a practical tendency will be found in
the effect which it produces upon the
circumstances of the people, and especially
upon those of the middle classes.
We, who have, from the very first,
anticipated the baneful effects of this
attack upon British industry&mdash;we,
who have no more connection than
any of yourselves with territorial aristocracy,
and who consider the welfare
of the people as the grand object
which it is the duty of the Government
to promote&mdash;ask you to apply
your own reason to the facts which
are before you and in your reach, and
to decide and act accordingly. It
was, we knew from the very beginning
of this struggle, impossible that
you could decide until the effects of
the Free-Trade experiment became
visible and palpable among yourselves.
We foresaw that it was only
through the suffering and impoverishment
of the producers that the practical
lesson could reach you, and that,
until this took place, it was of little
use to invoke your aid, or even to
entreat your judgment. Probably, by
this time, you will have formed an
accurate estimate of the value of the
doctrines promulgated by the babblers
on political economy&mdash;a sect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
which has never yet been allowed to
interfere with the internal affairs of
any nation, without producing the
most disastrous results. To them we
are indebted for that change of the
currency which has added fully one-third
to our fixed burdens, and for
those complex monetary arrangements
which insure periodically the
return of a commercial crisis. But
whatever you may think of them, do
not allow yourselves to be influenced
by their representations, or by those
of their accredited organs. The time
for theory is over. You have now to
deal with facts, regarding which every
man of you is competent to form an
opinion. We do not ask you to accept
our statements implicitly, any more
than those of our opponents&mdash;though,
if we did so, we might hold ourselves
justified on this ground, that the
greater part of our evidence is taken
from the admissions of our adversaries.
We appeal to your own
experience, and upon that we leave
you to decide.</p>

<p>And do not be afraid to give free
utterance to your opinion. There
exists not in this land&mdash;there exists
not in all the world, the power which
can rise up against you. The British
producer on the one hand, and the
exporting manufacturer on the other,
may have conflicting interests not
altogether reconcilable with the public
good, for isolated interest always
begets selfishness; and where individual
or class profit is concerned,
principle is apt to be overlooked.
But you are, eminently, <small>THE CLASS</small>
to pronounce upon conflicting opinions.
Your interest is that of the
nation whose pulse is beneath your
finger. You can tell, with greater
accuracy than others, whether any
political prescription has stimulated
the circulation of the blood, or caused
it to run torpidly in the national
veins. You can mark the changes in
the circumstances of your customers,
and from these you can form an estimate
whether or not the late experiment
has been successful.</p>

<p>If, judging by that test, you should
think it has been successful, our case
is lost. We, who have advocated the
Protective Principle in legislation,
cannot continue to maintain it, if
those whose incomes depend mainly
upon British custom find themselves
advantaged by measures which have
reduced the value of British produce.
In matters of this kind there is no
abstract dogma involved, on the
strength of which any man could
make himself a creditable martyr.
Men have died for their faith or for
their allegiance, believing either to be
their highest duty; but no one in his
senses will spend a lifetime, or any
considerable portion of it, in combating
absolute facts. The reason why
Protection is still a living principle&mdash;the
reason why it finds so many supporters
among the learned and the
thoughtful&mdash;the reason why it is progressing
step by step towards triumph&mdash;is
because, in the minds of
those who advocate it, there is a
strong and deep-rooted conviction that
you already know that the opposite
system has entirely failed to realise
the predictions of its advocates, and
that you feel that its permanency is
contrary to your interest, and to that
of the great body of the people. If
we are right in this conviction, then
we are entitled not only to solicit,
but to demand, your earnest co-operation.
These are not times for political
cowardice, or weak suppression
of opinion. Liberty of thought, and
liberty of the expression of sentiment,
are our unalienable prerogative; but
of late years, and in the hands of a
certain party, that prerogative has
been scandalously overstretched. We
now hear men&mdash;even members of the
Legislature&mdash;threatening the country,
and you, with hints of insurrection,
in case you exercise your undoubted
right of pronouncing a free and unbiassed
judgment upon any point of
commercial policy. Let the caitiffs
bluster! They know, from the bottom
of their ignoble souls&mdash;for none save
an ignoble soul would have dared to
conceive that such threats would intimidate
any man of British birth or
blood&mdash;that their menace is as meaningless
and vain as their miserable
motives are apparent. Let them
bluster! They, the advocates of
lowered wages&mdash;they, the combatants
for lengthened labour&mdash;they, the
crushers of the infants, have no large
margin of operative sympathy upon
which they can afford to trade. Had
John Fielden been alive, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
have told you what these men
were, and what sympathy they were
likely to command. Well do the
workmen know with whom they have
to deal!</p>

<p>Let us not be misunderstood. We
never have underrated the difficulty
of a change such as we contemplate;
but no difficulty attending that, is for
a moment to be put into the balance
against the general welfare of the
country, if, on reflection, and on considering
your own position, you shall
be of opinion that the interests of the
country demand that change. But,
at any hazard, we cannot afford to go
down-hill. To bring us, as the Manchester
men contemplate, to the Continental
level in point of wages as
well as expenditure, is to seal the
ruin of the British empire, burdened
as it is; or, in the least dangerous
view, to necessitate repudiation. That
matter is, as we have said before, for
you to decide; and the period for
your decision is rapidly drawing near.
On the next general election depends
the fate of the country, and&mdash;without
saying one syllable more upon the
merits of the systems at issue&mdash;the
decision or inclination of your body
will form the most important, because
it must be considered, as between
conflicting interests, the most impartial
element, of the expression of
British opinion.</p>

<h2>THE JEW'S LEGACY.</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>The note-book of my grandfather,
Major Flinders, contains much matter
relative to the famous siege of Gibraltar,
and he seems to have kept an
accurate and minute journal of such
of its incidents as came under his own
observation. Indeed, I suspect the
historian Drinkwater must have had
access to it, as I frequently find the
same notabilia chronicled in pretty
much the same terms by both these
learned Thebans. But while Drinkwater
confines himself mostly to professional
matters&mdash;the state of the
fortifications, nature of the enemy's
fire, casualties to the soldiery, and the
like&mdash;and seldom introduces an anecdote
interesting to the generality of
readers without apologising for such
levity, my grandfather's sympathies
seem to have been engrossed by the
sufferings of the inhabitants deprived
of shelter, as well as of sufficient food,
and helplessly witnessing the destruction
of their property. Consequently,
his journal, though quite below the
dignity of history, affords, now and
then, a tolerably graphic glimpse of
the beleagured town.</p>

<p>From the discursive and desultory
nature of the old gentleman's style,
as before hinted, it would be vain to
look for a continuous narrative in his
journal, even if it contained materials
for such. But here and there a literary
Jack Horner might extract a
plum or two from the vast quantity
of dough&mdash;of reflections, quotations,
and all manner of irrelevant observations,
surrounding them. The following
incidents, which occurred at
the most interesting period of the
long and tedious siege, appear to me
to give a fair idea of some of the characteristics
of the time, and of the
personages who figured in it; and
accordingly, after subjecting them to
a process analogous to gold-washing,
I present them to the reader.</p>

<p>After a strict blockade of six
months, reducing the garrison to great
extremity for want of provisions,
Gibraltar was relieved by Sir George
Rodney, who landed a large quantity
of stores. But about a year after his
departure, no further relief having
reached them except casual supplies
from trading vessels that came at a
great risk to the Rock, their exigencies
were even worse than before.
The issue of provisions was limited in
quantity, and their price so high, that
the families, even of officers, were frequently
in dismal straits. This has
given rise to a wooden joke of my
grandfather's, who, although he seldom
ventures on any deliberate facetiousness,
has entitled the volume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
his journal relating to this period of
the siege, <em>The Straits of Gibraltar</em>.
He seems to have estimated the
worth of his wit by its rarity, for the
words appear at the top of every
page.</p>

<p>The 11th of April 1781 being Carlota's
birthday, the Major had invited
Owen (now Lieutenant Owen) to dine
with them in honour of the occasion.
Owen was once more, for the time, a
single man; for Juana, having gone
to visit her friends in Tarifa just before
the commencement of the siege,
had been unable to rejoin her husband.
In vain had Carlota requested
that the celebration might be postponed
till the arrival of supplies from
England should afford them a banquet
worthy of the anniversary&mdash;the Major,
a great stickler for ancient customs,
insisted on its taking place forthwith.
Luckily, a merchantman from Minorca
had succeeded in landing a cargo of
sheep, poultry, vegetables, and fruit
the day before, so that the provision
for the feast, though by no means
sumptuous, was far better than any
they had been accustomed to for
many months past. The Major's
note-book enables me to set the materials
for the dinner, and also its cost,
before the reader&mdash;viz. a sheep's head,
price sixteen shillings, (my grandfather
was too late to secure any of
the body, which was rent in pieces,
and the fragments carried off as if by
wolves, ere the breath was well out
of it)&mdash;a couple of fowls, twenty
shillings, (scraggy creatures, says my
ancestor in a parenthesis)&mdash;a ham,
two guineas&mdash;raisins and flour for a
pudding, five shillings&mdash;eggs, (how
many the deponent sayeth not,) sixpence
each&mdash;vegetables, nine and sixpence&mdash;and
fruit for dessert, seven and
tenpence. Then, for wine, a Spanish
merchant, a friend of Carlota's, had
sent them two bottles of champagne
and one of amontillado, a present as
generous then as a hogshead would
have been in ordinary times; and
there was, moreover, some old rum,
and two lemons for punch. Altogether,
there was probably no dinner
half so good that day in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, the Major
was reading in his quarters (a tolerably
commodious house near the
South Barracks, and at some distance
outside the town) when Owen appeared.</p>

<p>"You're punctual, my boy; and
punctuality's a cardinal virtue about
dinner-time," said my grandfather,
looking at his watch; "three o'clock
exactly. And now we'll have dinner.
I only hope the new cook is a tolerable
proficient."</p>

<p>"What's become of Mrs Grigson?"
asked Owen. "You haven't parted
with that disciple of Apicius, I should
hope?"</p>

<p>"She's confined again," said my
grandfather, sighing; "a most prolific
woman that! It certainly can't
be above half-a-year since her last
child was born, and she's just going
to have another. 'Tis certainly not
longer ago than last autumn," he
added musingly.</p>

<p>"A wonderful woman," said Owen;
"she ought to be purchased by the
Government, and sent out to some of
our thinly-populated colonies. And
who fills her place?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll tell you," responded
the Major. "Joe Trigg, my old servant,
is confined too&mdash;in the guardroom,
I mean, for getting drunk&mdash;and
I've taken a man of the regiment,
one Private Bags, for a day or two,
who recommended his wife as an
excellent cook. She says the same
of herself; but this is her first trial,
and I'm a little nervous about it."</p>

<p>"Shocking rascal that Bags," said
Owen.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said my grandfather;
"I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't
inquire about his character. He offered
his services, saying he came from the
same part of England as myself,
though I don't recollect him."</p>

<p>"Terrible work this blockade," said
the Major after a pause. "Do you
know, if I was a general in command
of a besieging army, I don't think I
could find it in my heart to starve out
the garrison. Consider now, my dear
boy," (laying his forefinger on Owen's
arm,)&mdash;"consider, now, several thousand
men, with strong appetites,
never having a full meal for months
together. And just, too, as my digestion
was getting all right&mdash;for I never
get a nightmare now, though I frequently
have the most delicious
dreams of banquets that I try to eat,
but wake before I get a mouthful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
'Tis enough to provoke a saint. And,
as if this was not enough, the supply
of books is cut off. The <cite>Weekly
Entertainer</cite> isn't even an annual entertainer
to me. The last number I
got was in '79, and I've been a regular
subscriber these twelve years.
There's the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>,
too. The last one reached me a year
since, with a capital story in it, only
half-finished, that I'm anxious to know
the end of; and also a rebus that I've
been longing to see the answer to.
'The answer in our next,' says the
tantalising editor. It's a capital rebus&mdash;just
listen now. 'Two-thirds
of the name of an old novelist, one-sixth
of what we all do in the morning,
and a heathen deity, make together
a morsel fit for a king.' I've
been working at it for upwards of a
year, and I can't guess it. Can
you?"</p>

<p>"Roast pig with stuffing answers
the general description," said Owen.
"That, you'll admit, is a morsel fit
for a king."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said my grandfather.
"But you must really try now. I've
run through the mythology, all that I
know of it, and tried all the old novelists'
names, even Boccaccio and Cervantes.
Never were such combinations
as I've made&mdash;but can't compound
anything edible out of them. Again,
as to what we do in the morning: we
all shave, (that is, all who have
beards)&mdash;and we yawn, too; at least
I do, on waking; but it must be a
word of six letters. Then, who can
the heathen deity be?"</p>

<p>"Pan is the only heathen deity
that has anything to do with cookery,"
said Owen. "Frying-pan, you know,
and stew-pan."</p>

<p>My grandfather caught at the idea,
but had not succeeded in making anything
of it, or in approximating to the
solution of the riddle, when Carlota
entered from an inner room.</p>

<p>"I wish, my dear, you would see
about the dinner," said the Major;
"'tis a quarter past three."</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, mi vida</i>," (yes, my life,) said
Carlota, who was in the habit of bestowing
lavishly on my grandfather
the most endearing epithets in the
Spanish language, some of them, perhaps,
not particularly applicable&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niño
de mi alma</i>, (child of my soul,)
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">luz de mis ojos</i>, (light of my eyes,) and
the like; none of which appeared to
have any more effect on the object of
them than if they had been addressed
to somebody else.</p>

<p>Carlota rung the bell, which nobody
answered. "Nurse is busy with de
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niña</i>," she said, when nobody answered
it; "I go myself to de <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cocina</i>,"
(kitchen,)&mdash;she spoke English as yet
but imperfectly.</p>

<p>"There's one comfort in delay,"
said the Major; "'tis better to boil a
ham too much than too little&mdash;and yet
I shouldn't like it overdone either."</p>

<p>Here they were alarmed by an exclamation
from Carlota. "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ah Dios!
Caramba! Ven, ven, mi niño!</i>" cried
she from the kitchen.</p>

<p>The Major and Owen hastened to
the kitchen, which was so close at
hand that the smell of the dinner
sometimes anticipated its appearance
in the dining-room. Mrs Bags, the
new cook, was seated before the fire.
On the table beside her was an empty
champagne bottle, the fellow to which
protruded its neck from a pail in one
corner, where the Major had put it to
cool; and another bottle of more
robust build, about half-full, was also
beside her. The countenance of Mrs
Bags wore a pleasant and satisfied,
though not very intelligent smile, as
she gazed steadfastly on the ham that
was roasting on a spit before the fire&mdash;at
least one side of it was done
quite black, while the other oozed
with warm greese; for the machinery
which should have turned it was not
in motion.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caramba!</i>" exclaimed Carlota,
with uplifted hands. "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que picarilla!</i>"&mdash;(What
a knave of a woman!)</p>

<p>"Gracious heavens!" said my
grandfather, "she's roasting it! Who
ever heard of a roast ham?"</p>

<p>"A many years," remarked Mrs
Bags, without turning her head, and
still smiling pleasantly, "have I lived
in gentlemen's families&mdash;" Here this
fragment of autobiography was terminated
by a hiccup.</p>

<p>"And the champagne bottle is
empty," said Owen, handling it. "A
nice sort of cook this of yours, Major.
She seems to have constituted herself
butler, too."</p>

<p>My grandfather advanced and
lifted the other bottle to his nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
"'Tis the old rum," he ejaculated
with a groan. "But if the woman
has drunk all this 'twill be the death
of her. Bags," he called, "come
here."</p>

<p>The spouse of Mrs Bags emerged
from a sort of scullery behind the
kitchen&mdash;a tall bony man, of an ugliness
quite remarkable, and with a
very red face. He was better known
by his comrades as Tongs, in allusion
probably to personal peculiarities; for
the length of his legs, the width of
his bony hips, and the smallness of
his head, gave him some distant resemblance
to that article of domestic
ironmongery; but as his wife called
herself Mrs Bags, and he was entered
in the regimental books by that name,
it was probably his real appellation.</p>

<p>"Run directly to Dr Fagan," said
the Major, "and request him to come
here. Your wife has poisoned herself
with rum."</p>

<p>"'Tisn't rum," said Bags, somewhat
thickly&mdash;"'tis fits."</p>

<p>"Fits!" said my grandfather.</p>

<p>"Fits," doggedly replied Mr Bags,
who seemed by no means disturbed
at the alleged indisposition of his
wife&mdash;"she often gets them."</p>

<p>"Don't alarm yourself, Major,"
said Owen, "I'll answer for it she
hasn't drunk <em>all</em> the rum. The
scoundrel is half-drunk himself, and
smells like a spirit-vault. You'd
better take your wife away," he said
to Bags.</p>

<p>"She can leave if she ain't wanted,"
said Private Bags, with dignity: "we
never comes where we ain't wanted."
And he advanced to remove the lady.
Mrs Bags at first resisted this measure,
proceeding to deliver a eulogium
on her own excellent qualities, moral
and culinary. She had, she said, the
best of characters, in proof of which
she made reference to several persons
in various parts of the United Kingdom,
and, as she spoke, she smiled
more affably than ever.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La picarilla no tiene verguenza</i>,"
(the wretch is perfectly shameless,)
cried Carlota, who, having hastily
removed the ham from the fire, was
now looking after the rest of the
dinner. The fowls, cut up in small
pieces, were boiling along with the
sheep's head, and, probably to save
time, the estimable Mrs Bags had put
the rice and raisins destined for a
pudding into the pot along with them&mdash;certainly,
as Owen remarked, a
bold innovation in cookery.</p>

<p>Still continuing to afford them
glimpses of her personal history, Mrs
Bags was at length persuaded to
retire along with her helpmate.</p>

<p>"What astonishing impudence," said
the Major, shutting the door upon her,
"to pretend to be a cook, and yet
know no better than to roast a ham!"</p>

<p>Carlota, meanwhile, was busy in
remedying the disaster as far as she
could; cutting the ham into slices
and frying it, making a fricassee of the
fowls, and fishing the raisins out of
the pot, exclaiming bitterly all the
while, in English and Spanish, against
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tunanta</i> (equivalent to female
scoundrel or scamp) who had spoilt
the only nice dinner her <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pobrecito</i>,
her <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niño</i>, her <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">querido</i>, (meaning my
grandfather,) had been likely to enjoy
for a long time, stopping occasionally
in her occupations to give him a consolatory
kiss. However, my grandfather
did not keep up the character
of a martyr at all well: he took the
matter really very patiently; and
when the excellent Carlota had set
the dinner on the table, and he tasted
the fine flavour of the maltreated
ham, he speedily regained his accustomed
good-humour.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," he said presently,
while searching with a fork in
the dish before him, "that a pair of
fowls should have only three wings,
two legs, and one breast between
them."</p>

<p>It certainly was not according to
the order of nature; nevertheless the
fact was so, all my grandfather's
researches in the dish failing to bring
to light the missing members. This
however, was subsequently explained
by the discovery of the remains of
these portions of the birds in the
scullery, where they appeared to have
been eaten after being grilled; and
Mrs Bags' reason for adopting this
mode of cooking them was also rendered
apparent&mdash;viz., that she might
secure a share for herself without immediate
detection.</p>

<p>However, all this did not prevent
them from making the best of what
was left, and the Major's face beamed
as he drank Carlota's health in a glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
of the remaining bottle of champagne,
as brightly as if the dinner had been
completely successful.</p>

<p>"It is partly my fault, Owen,"
said the Major, "that you haven't a
joint of mutton instead of this sheep's
head. I ought to have been sharper.
The animal was actually sold in parts
before he was killed. Old Clutterbuck
had secured a haunch, and he a
single man you know&mdash;'tis thrown
away upon him. I offered him something
handsome for his bargain, but
he wouldn't part with it."</p>

<p>"We're lucky to get any," returned
Owen. "Never was such a scramble.
Old Fiskin, the commissary, and Mrs
O'Regan, the Major's wife, both
swore the left leg was knocked down
to them; neither would give in, and
it was put up again, when the staff
doctor, Pursum, who had just arrived
in a great hurry, carried it off by
bidding eightpence more than either.
Not one of the three has spoken to
either of the others since; and people
say," added Owen, "Mrs O'Regan
avers openly that Fiskin didn't behave
like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"God knows!" said my grandfather,
"'tis a difficult thing in such a
case to decide between politeness and
a consciousness of being in the right.
Fiskin likes a good dinner."</p>

<p>The dinner having been done justice
to, Carlota removed the remains to a
side-table, and the Major was in the
act of compounding a bowl of punch,
when there was a knock at the door.
"Come in," cried Carlota.</p>

<p>A light and timid step crossed the
narrow passage separating the outer
door from that of the room they sat
in, and there was another hesitating
tap at this latter. "Come in," again
cried Carlota, and a young girl entered
with a basket on her arm.</p>

<p>"'Tis Esther Lazaro," said Carlota
in Spanish. "Come in, child; sit
here and tell me what you want."</p>

<p>Esther Lazaro was the daughter of
a Jew in the town, whose occupations
were multifarious, and connected him
closely with the garrison. He discounted
officers' bills, furnished their
rooms, sold them everything they
wanted&mdash;all at most exorbitant rates.
Still, as is customary with military
men, while perfectly aware that they
could have procured what he supplied
them with elsewhere at less expense,
they continued to patronise and abuse
him rather than take the trouble of
looking out for a more liberal dealer.
As the difficulties of the garrison increased,
he had not failed to take
advantage of them, and it was even
said he was keeping back large stores
of provisions and necessaries till the
increasing scarcity should enable
him to demand his own terms for
them.</p>

<p>His daughter was about fifteen
years old&mdash;a pretty girl, with hair of
the unusual colour of chestnut, plaited
into thick masses on the crown of her
head. Her skin was fairer than is
customary with her race&mdash;her eyes
brown and soft in expression, her
face oval, and her figure, even at this
early age, very graceful, being somewhat
more precocious than an English
girl's at those years. She was a
favourite with the ladies of the garrison,
who often employed her to procure
feminine matters for them. Carlota,
particularly, had always treated
her with great kindness&mdash;and hence
the present visit. She had come, she
said timidly, to ask a favour&mdash;a great
favour. She had a little dog that she
loved. (Here a great commotion in the
basket seemed to say she had brought
her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> with her.) He had been
given to her by a young school friend
who was dead, and her father would
no longer let her keep it, because, he
said, these were no times to keep
such creatures, when provisions, even
those fit for a dog, were so dear. He
was a very good little dog&mdash;would the
Señora take him?</p>

<p>"Let us look at him, Esther,"
said Owen&mdash;"I see you have brought
him with you."</p>

<p>"He is not pretty," said Esther,
blushing as she produced him from
the basket. He certainly was not,
being a small cur, marked with black
and white, like a magpie, with a tall
curling over his back. He did not
appear at all at his ease in society,
for he tried to shrink back again into
the basket.</p>

<p>"He was frightened," she said,
"for he had been shut up for more
than a month. She had tried to keep
him in her bedroom, unknown to her
father, feeding him with part of her
own meals; but he had found it out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
and had beaten her, and threatened
to kill the dog if ever he saw it
again."</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pobrecito!</i>" (poor little thing,)
said the good Carlota&mdash;"we shall take
good care of it. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Toma</i>," (take this,)
offering him a bit of meat. But he
crept under her chair, with his tail so
depressed, in his extreme bashfulness,
that the point of it came out between
his forelegs.</p>

<p>Carlota would have made the young
Jewess dine there forthwith, at the
side-table still spread with the remains
of the dinner; but she refused
to take anything, only sipping once
from a glass of wine that Carlota insisted
on making her drink of. Then
she rose, and, having tied the end of
a string that was fastened to the dog's
collar to the leg of the table, to prevent
his following her, took her leave,
thanking Carlota very prettily.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">A Dios, Sancho!</i>" she said to
the little dog, who wagged his tail
and gave her a piteous look as she
turned to go away&mdash;"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">A Dios,
Sancho</i>," she repeated, taking him up
and kissing him very affectionately.
The poor child was ready to cry.</p>

<p>"Come and see him every day,
my child," said Carlota, "and when
better times come you shall have him
again."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>Lazaro the Jew was seated towards
dusk that evening in a sort of office
partitioned off by an open railing
from a great store filled with a most
motley collection of articles. Sofas,
looking-glasses, washing-stands&mdash;bales
of goods in corded canvass&mdash;rows
of old boots purchased from officers'
servants&mdash;window curtains lying on
heaps of carpeting and matting&mdash;bedsteads
of wood and iron&mdash;crockery
and glass&mdash;were all piled indiscriminately.
Similar articles had also
overflowed along the passage down
the wooden steps leading to the
square stone court below, which was
lumbered with barrels, packing-cases,
and pieces of old iron. This court
was entered from the street, and an
arched door on one side of it, barred
and padlocked, opened on a large
warehouse, which nobody except the
Jew had set foot in for many months.</p>

<p>The Jew himself was a spare,
rather small man, with a thin eager
face, small sharp features, and a
scanty beard. Being by descent a
Barbary Jew, he wore the costume
peculiar to that branch of his race&mdash;a
black skull-cap; a long-skirted, collarless,
cloth coat, buttoned close, the
waist fastened with a belt; loose
light-coloured trousers and yellow
slippers&mdash;altogether he looked somewhat
like an overgrown scholar of
Christ's Hospital. He was busied in
turning over old parchment-covered
ledgers, when an officer entered.</p>

<p>Von Dessel was a captain in Hardenberg's
regiment. He was a square,
strong-built man, about forty, with
very light hair, as was apparent since
the governor's order had forbidden the
use of powder to the troops, in consequence
of the scarcity of flour.
His thick, white, overhanging eyebrows,
close lips, and projecting under
jaw gave sternness to his countenance.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, captain," said
the Jew; "what I do for you to-day,
sare?"</p>

<p>"Do for me! By Gott, you have
done for me already, with your cursed
Hebrew tricks," said the captain.
The German and the Jew met on a
neutral ground of broken English.</p>

<p>"I always treat every gentleman
fair, sare," said the Jew. "I tell you,
captain, I lose by that last bill of
yours."</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der teufel!</i> who gains, then?"
said Von Dessel, "for you cut me off
thirty per cent."</p>

<p>The Jew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't make it so, sare; the siege
makes it so. When the port is open,
you shall have more better exchange."</p>

<p>"Well, money must be had," said
the German. "What will you give
now for my bill for twenty pounds?"</p>

<p>The Jew consulted a book of
figures&mdash;then made some calculations
on paper&mdash;then appeared to consider
intently.</p>

<p>"Curse you, speak!" said the
choleric captain. "You have made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
your mind about how much roguery
long ago."</p>

<p>"Captain, sare, I give you feefty
dallars," said the Jew.</p>

<p>The captain burst forth with a
volley of German execrations.</p>

<p>"Captain," said the Jew presently,
"I like to please a gentleman if I
can. I give you one box of cigars
besides&mdash;real Cubas&mdash;one hundred
and feefty in a box."</p>

<p>The captain at this broke forth
again, but checked himself presently
on the entrance of the Jew's daughter,
who now returned from the Major's.
She advanced quietly into the room,
made a little bow to the captain, took
off and laid aside her shawl, and,
taking up some work, sat down and
began to sew.</p>

<p>Von Dessel resumed his expostulation
in a milder tone. The Jew,
however, knew the money was necessary
to him, and only yielded so far
as to increase his box of cigars to
two hundred; and the captain, finding
he could get no better terms from
him, was forced to agree. While the
Jew was drawing out the bills, the
German gazed attentively at Esther,
with a good deal of admiration expressed
in his countenance.</p>

<p>"I can't take the money now,"
said he, after signing the bills. "I
am going on duty. Bring it to
me to-morrow morning, at nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't, sare," said
Lazaro; "too moch business.
Couldn't you send for it, captain?"</p>

<p>"Not possible," said the German;
"but you must surely have somebody
that might bring it&mdash;some trustworthy
person you know." And his
eye rested on Esther.</p>

<p>"There's my dater, sare," said the
Jew&mdash;"I shall send her, if that will
do."</p>

<p>"Good," said the captain, "do not
forget," and quitted the room forthwith.</p>

<p>He was scarcely gone when a pair
with whom the reader is already
slightly acquainted, Mr and Mrs
Bags, presented themselves. The
effects of their morning conviviality
had in a great measure disappeared.</p>

<p>"Your servant, sir," said Bags.
The Jew nodded.</p>

<p>"We've got a few articles to dispose
of," pursued Mr Bags, looking
round the room cautiously. "They
was left us," he added in a low tone,
"by a <em>diseased</em> friend."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Jew, "never
mind where you got 'em. Be quick&mdash;show
them."</p>

<p>Mrs Bags produced from under her
cloak, first a tin teakettle, then a brass
saucepan; and Mr Bags, unbuttoning
his coat, laid on the table three knives
and a silver fork. Esther, passing
near the table at the time, glanced
accidentally at the fork, and recognised
the Flinders crest&mdash;a talbot, or
old English bloodhound.</p>

<p>"Father," said she hastily, in
Spanish, "don't have anything to do
with that&mdash;it must be stolen." But
the Jew turned so sharply on her,
telling her to mind her work, that
she retreated.</p>

<p>The Jew took up the tea-kettle, and
examined the bottom to see that it
was sound&mdash;did the same with the
saucepan&mdash;looked at the knives narrowly,
and still closer at the fork&mdash;then
ranged them before him on the
table.</p>

<p>"For dis," said he, laying his hand
on the tea-kettle, "we will say one
pound of rice; for dis (the saucepan)
two pounds of corned beef; for de
knives, a bottle of rum; and for de
fork, seex ounces of the best tea."</p>

<p>"Curse your tea!" said Mr Bags.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Mrs Bags, who had
with difficulty restrained herself during
the process of valuation, "we
doesn't want no tea. And the things
is worth a much more than what you
say: the saucepan's as good as new,
and the fork's silver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plated," said the Jew, weighing
it across his finger.</p>

<p>"A many years," said Mrs Bags,
"have I lived in gentlemen's families,
and well do I know plate from silver.
I've lived with Mrs Milson of Pidding
Hill, where everything was silver,
and nothing plated, even to the
handles of the doors; and a dear good
lady she was to me; many's the gown,
she giv me. And I've lived with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the Jew unceremoniously interrupted
the train of her recollections
by pushing the things from before
him. "Take what I offer, or else
take your things away," said he,
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Bags grumbled considerably.
The tea they positively refused
at any price: Mr Bags didn't
like it, and Mrs Bags said it disagreed
with her. So the Jew agreed to give
them instead another bottle of rum,
a pound of onions, and two pounds of
beef; and with these terms they at
length closed, and departed with the
results of their barter.</p>

<p>During the altercation, a soldier of
another regiment had entered, and
stood silently awaiting his turn to be
attended to. He was a gaunt man,
with want written legibly in the hollows
of his face and the dismal eagerness
of his eye. He now came forward,
and with trembling hands unfolded
an old gown, and handed it to the
Jew.</p>

<p>"'Tis no good to me," said the
latter, giving it back, after holding it
against the light; "nothing but
holes."</p>

<p>"But my wife has no other," said
the man: "'tis her last stitch of
clothes, except her petticoat and a
blanket. I've brought everything else
to you."</p>

<p>The Jew shrugged his shoulders
and spread out his hands, in token
that he could not help it.</p>

<p>"I swear 'tis her last!" reiterated
the man, as if he really fancied this
fact must give the garment as much
value in the Jew's eyes as in his
own.</p>

<p>"I tell you I won't have it!" said
the Jew, testily.</p>

<p>"Give me only a loaf for it, or but
one pound of potatoes," said the soldier:
"'tis more than my wife and
four children have had among them
for two days. Half-rations for one,
among six of us, is too hard to live."</p>

<p>"A pound of potatoes," said the
Jew, "is worth four reals and a-half&mdash;eighteenpence;
your wife's gown is
worth&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Then take this," said the man,
beginning frantically to pull off his
uniform coat; "anything is better
than starving."</p>

<p>The Jew laughed. "What!" said
he, "you think I don't know better
than to buy a soldier's necessaries,
eh? Ah, ah! no such a fool, I think,
my friend. What your captain say?&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The man struck his hand violently
on the table. "Then give me&mdash;or
lend me," said he, "some food, much
or little, and I'll work for you every
hour I'm off duty till you're satisfied.
I will, Mr Lazaro, so help me
God!"</p>

<p>"I got plenty of men to work for
me," said Lazaro; "don't want any
more. Come again, when you've got
something to sell, my friend."</p>

<p>The man rolled up the gown without
speaking, then lifted it over his
head, and dashed it into the furthest
corner of the store. He was hurrying
from the place, when, as if unwilling
to throw away his last chance, he
turned back, gathered it up, and,
thrusting it under his arm, quitted
the store with lingering steps, as if
he even yet hoped to be called back.
No such summons reached him, however;
but, immediately after he was
gone, Esther rose and stole softly
down the stairs. She overtook him
at the street-door opening from the
court before mentioned, and laid her
hand on his arm. The man turned
and glared on her. "What!&mdash;he'll
buy it, will he?" said he.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Esther&mdash;"keep it
for your poor wife. Look; I have no
money, but take these," and she
placed in his hand two earrings
hastily detached from her ears.</p>

<p>The man stood looking at her for a
space, as if stupified, without closing
his hand on the trinkets that lay on
the palm; then, suddenly rousing
himself, he swore, with tears in his
eyes, that for this service he would
do for her anything on earth she
should require from him; but she
only begged him to go away at once,
and say nothing, lest her father should
overhear the transaction, who would
certainly be angry with her for it.</p>

<p>Bags and his wife had stopt in a
corner of the court, to pack up their
property in a commodious form for
conveyance, and had witnessed this
scene in silence. As soon as the
soldier had, in compliance with Esther's
entreaties, disappeared, Bags
came forward.</p>

<p>"And your father would be angry,
would he, my dear?" said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, very&mdash;oh, so angry! Please
don't stop me," she said, trying to
pass him.</p>

<p>"And what'll ye give me not to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
him, now?" asked Mr Bags. "Ain't
ye got nothing for me?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no&mdash;indeed, nothing. Do
let me pass."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have; you've got this,
I think," said Bags, snatching at a
silver-mounted comb glistening in her
hair, which, thus loosened, all fell
down on her shoulders as she darted
past him. "And now," said Mr
Bags, inspecting his prize, "I think
me and that 'ere cheating Jew is quits
for the silver fork. I'll allow it's
plated now."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>Early the next morning (the 12th of
April) a rumour went through the
town that an English fleet was signalled
as in sight. The news roused
the starving people like electricity.
The pale spectres of men that, on the
previous day, had stalked so gauntly
through the dreary streets&mdash;the
wretched, sinking women, and children
careworn as grandfathers&mdash;poured
forth, with something like a
natural light in their hollow eyes, to
witness the joyful spectacle. The
sea-wall of the city was, like the margin
of a vast pool of Bethesda, thronged
with hopeful wretches awaiting
the coming of the angel.</p>

<p>The streets were instantly deserted.
Those who could not leave their
homes got on the housetops, but the
great mass of the population spread
itself along the line-wall, the Grand
Parade and Alameda, and the heights
skirting the chief slopes of the
Rock. Moors and Jews, Spaniards
and English, citizens and soldiers,
men, women, and children, of all
ages, grades, and nations, ranged
themselves indiscriminately wherever
they could obtain a view of the sea.</p>

<p>For some time the wished-for sight
was delayed by a thick fog that
spread itself across the Straits and
the entrance of the bay. A murmur
rose from each successive rank of
people that forced itself into a front
place on the line-wall. Terrible
doubts flew about, originating no one
knew where, but gaining strength and
confirmation as they passed from
mouth to mouth. On the summit of
the Rock behind them the signal for
a fleet flew steadily from the mast at
Middle Hill; but still in this, as in
all crowds, were some of little faith,
who were full of misgivings. Many
rushed up to the signal station, unable
to bear the pain of the delay. My
grandfather noticed the Jew Lazaro
among the throng, watching the event
with an anxious eye, though his anxiety
was from the opposite cause to
that of most of the spectators. The
arrival of supplies would at once
bring down the price of provisions,
and rob him, for the present, of his
expected profits; and as each successive
rumour obtained credence with
the crowd, his countenance brightened
as their hopes fell, and sank as they
again emerged from despondency.</p>

<p>Not far from him was an old
Genoese woman, wearing the quaint
red cloak, trimmed with black velvet,
that old Genoese women usually wear
in Gibraltar. She hovered round the
skirts of the crowd, occasionally
peering beneath an uplifted arm,
or thrusting it between two obstructing
figures, to catch a glimpse, though
it was evident that her dim eyes
would fail to discern the fleet when
it should come in view. Her thin
shrivelled features, relieved against
her black hood, were positively wolfish
from starvation. She frequently drew
one hand from beneath her cloak, and
gazed at something she held in it&mdash;then,
muttering, she would again conceal
it. My grandfather's curiosity
was roused. He drew near and watched
for the reappearance of the object
that so engrossed her. It was a blue
mouldy crust of bread.</p>

<p>The wished-for spectacle was at
length revealed. "As the sun became
more powerful," says Drinkwater,
rising into positive poetry
with the occasion, "the fog gradually
rose, <em>like the curtain of a vast theatre</em>,
discovering to the anxious garrison
one of the most beautiful and pleasing
scenes it is possible to conceive. The
convoy, consisting of near a hundred
vessels, were in a compact body, led
by several men-of-war&mdash;their sails
just filled enough for steerage, while
the majority of the line-of-battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
ships lay to under the Barbary shore,
having orders not to enter the bay,
lest the enemy should molest them
with their fireships."</p>

<p>Then rose a great shout&mdash;at once
the casting-off of long-pressing anxiety
and the utterance of delight. Happy
tears streamed down haggard faces
overgrown with hair, and presently
men turned to one another, smiling
in the face of a stranger neighbour
as in that of an old friend, while a
joyful murmur, distilled from many
languages, rose upward. Assuredly,
if blessings are of any avail, the soul
of Admiral Darby, who commanded
the relieving fleet, is at this moment
in Paradise.</p>

<p>Friends and relations now began
to search for one another in the
crowd, which broke quickly into
knots, each contriving how to enjoy
together the plenty that was to
descend upon them. My grandfather's
eye at this juncture was
again attracted by the old Genoese
woman. When the crowd shouted,
she screened her eyes with her
withered hand, and, with her nostril
spread, her chin fallen, in her eagerness
gazed towards the sea&mdash;but
presently shook her head, discerning
nothing. Then she plucked by the
arm a joyful Spaniard.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Es verdad? Por Dios, es verdad?</i>"
she cried; "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">jura! jura!</i>"&mdash;(Is it
true? Swear by Heaven it is
true.)</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, si,</i>" said the Spaniard, pointing;
"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">es verdad</i>," ('tis true.) "You
may see them yourself."</p>

<p>Instantly the old woman, for the
last time, drew forth her treasured
crust, and began to devour it, muttering,
as she tore away each mouthful,
"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mas mañana! mas mañana!</i>"
(I shall have more to-morrow&mdash;more
to-morrow!)</p>

<p>After the crowd had partially dispersed,
Owen was returning to his
quarters to breakfast, when, as he
paused to open the door, he heard
a voice he thought he knew crying
out in affright in the rooms opposite,
where Von Dessel resided. Presently
the door of the quarters was opened,
and the flushed and frightened face
of Esther Lazaro appeared, as she
struggled to escape from Von Dessel,
who held her arm.</p>

<p>"Señor, señor, speak to the gentleman!"
she cried to Owen.</p>

<p>"Leetle foolish girl," said Von
Dessel, grinning a smile on seeing
him; "she frightens at nothing.
Come in, child"&mdash;trying to shut the
door.</p>

<p>"Why don't you let her alone?"
said Owen; "don't you see she
doesn't like you?"</p>

<p>"Pouf!" said the captain. "We
all have trouble with them sometimes&mdash;you
must know that well."</p>

<p>"No, by Jupiter!" cried Frank
Owen. "If I couldn't gain them
willingly, they might go to the
devil for me. But you hurt her&mdash;pray
let her go&mdash;you must indeed."</p>

<p>"Do you mind your own affair,"
said the captain, "and don't
meddle;" and, exerting his strength,
he drew Esther in, and partially
succeeded in shutting the door&mdash;she
calling the while again on Owen
to help her. Frank stepped forward,
and, putting his foot against the
door, sent it into the room, causing
Captain Von Dessel, who was behind
it, to stagger back with some
violence, and to quit his hold of
Esther, who ran down stairs.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the captain,
stalking grimly out of his room, pale
with rage. "You have thought
right to interfere with me, and to
insult me. By Gott! I will teach
you better, young man. Shall we
say in one hour, sir, in the Fives'
Court?"</p>

<p>Owen nodded. "At your pleasure,"
said he, and, entering his own quarters,
shut the door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my grandfather walked
about with the telescope he had
brought with him to look after the
fleet under his arm, enjoying the
unusual sight of happy faces around
him. And he has remarked it as a
singular feature of humanity, that
this prospect of relief from physical
want inspired a far more deep and
universal joy than he had witnessed
in any public rejoicings arising from
such causes as loyalty or patriotism
evinced at a coronation or the
news of a great victory; and hence
my grandfather takes occasion to
express a fear that human nature, as
well as other nature, is, except
among the rarer class of souls, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
powerfully and generally influenced
by its animal propensities than by
more refined causes.</p>

<p>He was so engrossed with the
philanthropic pursuit of enjoying the
joy of the multitude, and the philosophic
one of extracting moral reflections
therefrom, that he quite forgot
he had not breakfasted. He was
just beginning to be reminded of the
circumstance by a feeling of hollowness
in the region of the stomach,
and to turn his steps homeward, when
a light hand was laid on his arm.
My grandfather turned, and beheld
the face of the young Jewess looking
wistfully in his.</p>

<p>She began at first to address him
in Spanish&mdash;the language she spoke
most naturally; but, quickly perceiving
her mistake on hearing the
extraordinary jargon in which he
replied, (for it is a singular fact that
nobody but Carlota, who taught
him, could understand my grandfather's
Spanish,) she exchanged it
for his own tongue. She told him
in a few hurried words of the quarrel
Owen had incurred on her account
with Von Dessel, and of the challenge
she had overheard given by
the latter, beseeching the major to
hasten to prevent the result.</p>

<p>"In the Fives' Court! in an
hour!" said my grandfather. "When
did this happen?"</p>

<p>Esther thought nearly an hour
ago&mdash;she had been almost so long
seeking my grandfather.</p>

<p>"I'll go, child&mdash;I'll go at once,"
said the Major. "With Von Dessel,
too, as if he could find nobody else
to quarrel with but the best swordsman
in the garrison. 'Souls and
bodies' quoted my grandfather,
'hath he divorced three.'"</p>

<p>With every stride he took, the
Major's uneasiness was augmented.
At any time his anxiety would have
been extreme while peril threatened
Frank; but now, when he was calculating
on him as a companion at
many a well-spread table, when they
might forget their past miseries, it
peculiarly affected him.</p>

<p>"To think," muttered my grandfather,
"that these two madmen
should choose a time when everybody
is going to be made so happy,
by getting plenty to eat, to show
their gratitude to Providence by
cutting one another's throats!"</p>

<p>The danger to Owen was really
formidable; for, though a respectable
swordsman, he was no unusual proficient
in the graceful art, while his
opponent was not only, as my grandfather
had said, the best swordsman
in the garrison, but perhaps the
best at that time in the army. As
a student in Germany he had distinguished
himself in some sanguinary
duels; and since his arrival in Gibraltar,
a Spanish gentleman, a very
able fencer, had fallen beneath his
arm.</p>

<p>"God grant," said my grandfather
to himself, as he neared the
Fives' Court, "that we may settle
this without the perdition of souls.
Frank, my dear boy, we could better
spare a better man!"</p>

<p>On attempting to enter the Fives'
Court he was stopped by the master,
posted at the door. "It was engaged,"
he said, "for a private
match."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said my grandfather,
pushing past him; "a pretty match,
indeed! Ay, ay&mdash;pray God we can
stop it!"</p>

<p>Finding the inner door locked, the
Major, who was well acquainted
with the locality&mdash;for, when he had
nothing else particular to do, he
would sometimes mark for the
players for a rubber or two&mdash;ascended
the stairs to the gallery.</p>

<p>About the centre of the court
stood the combatants. All preliminaries
had been gone through&mdash;for
they were stripped to their shirts&mdash;and
the seconds (one a German, the
adjutant of Hardenberg's regiment&mdash;the
other, one Lieutenant Rushton,
an old hand at these affairs, and
himself a fire-eater) stood by, each
with a spare sword in his hand. In
a corner was the German regimental
surgeon, his apparatus displayed on
the floor, ready for an emergency.
Rushton fully expected Owen to
fall, and only hoped he might
escape without a mortal wound.
Von Dessel himself seemed of the
same opinion, standing square and
firm as a tower, scarcely troubling
himself to assume an attitude, but
easy and masterly withal. Both contempt
and malice were expressed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
his antagonist in his half-shut eyes
and sardonic twist of the corners of
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Owen, Owen, my boy!" shouted
my grandfather, rushing to the front
of the gallery, and leaning over, as
the swords crossed&mdash;"stop, for God's
sake. You mustn't fight that swashbuckler!
They say he hath been fencer
to the Sophy," roared the Major, in
the words of Sir Toby Belch.</p>

<p>The combatants just turned their
heads for a moment to look at the
interrupter, and again crossed swords.</p>

<p>Immediately on finding his remonstrance
disregarded, the Major descended
personally into the arena&mdash;not
by the ordinary route of the stairs,
but the shorter one of a perpendicular
drop from the gallery, not effected
with the lightness of a feathered Mercury.
But the clatter of his descent
was lost in the concussion of a discharge
of artillery that shook the
walls. Instantly the air was alive
with shot and hissing shells; and before
the echoes of the first discharge
had ceased, the successive explosion
of the shells in the air, and the crashing
of chimneys, shattered doors, and
falling masonry, increased the uproar.
One shell burst in the court, filling
it with smoke. My grandfather felt,
for a minute, rather dizzy with the
shock. When the smoke cleared, by
which time he had partially recovered
himself, the first object that caught
his eye was Von Dessel lying on the
pavement, and the doctor stooping
over him. The only other person
hurt was Rushton, a great piece of
the skin of whose forehead, detached
by a splinter, was hanging over his
right eye. Von Dessel had sustained
a compound fracture of the thigh,
while the loss of two fingers from his
right hand had spoiled his thrust in
tierce for ever.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter?" said
my grandfather, looking upward, as
a second flight of missiles hurtled overhead.</p>

<p>"Matter enough," quoth Rushton,
mopping the blood from his eye with
his handkerchief; "those cursed
devils of Spaniards are bombarding
the town."</p>

<p>The Major went up to Owen, and
squeezed his hand. "We won't abuse
the Spaniards for all that," said
he&mdash;"they've saved your life, my
boy."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>Enraged at seeing their blockade
evaded by the arrival of Darby's fleet,
the Spaniards revenged themselves
by directing such a fire upon Gibraltar,
from their batteries in the Neutral
Ground, as in a short time reduced
the town to a mass of ruins. This
misfortune was rendered the more intolerable
to the besieged, as it came in
the moment of exultation and general
thanksgiving. While words of congratulation
were passing from mouth
to mouth, the blow descended, and
"turned to groans their roundelay."</p>

<p>The contrast between the elation
of the inhabitants when my grandfather
entered the Fives' Court, and
their universal consternation and despair
when he quitted it, was terrible.
The crowd that had a few minutes
before so smilingly and hopefully entered
their homes, now fled from them
in terror. Again the streets were
thronged by the unhappy people, who
began to believe themselves the sport
of some powerful and malevolent demon.
Whole families, parents, children,
and servants, rushed together
into the streets, making their way to
the south to escape the missiles that
pursued them. Some bore pieces of
furniture snatched up in haste, and
apparently seized because they came
first to hand; some took the chairs
they had been sitting on; one man
my grandfather noticed bearing away
with difficulty the leaf of a mahogany
table, leaving behind the legs which
should have supported it; and a
woman had a crying child in one
hand, and in the other a gridiron, still
reeking with the fat of some meat she
had been cooking. Rubbish from the
houses began to strew the streets;
and here and there a ragged breach
in a wall rent by the cannon afforded
a strange incongruous glimpse of the
room inside, with its mirrors, tables,
and drapery, just as the inhabitants
left them. Armed soldiers were hastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
to their different points of
assembly, summoned by bugles that
resounded shrilly amid the din, and
thrusting their way unceremoniously
through the impeding masses of fugitives.</p>

<p>The house of the Jew Lazaro was
one of the first that was seriously injured.
The blank wall of the great
warehouse before mentioned, that
faced the street, had, either from age
or bad masonry, long before exhibited
several cracks. A large segment,
bounded by two of these cracks, had
been knocked away by a shot, and
the superincumbent mass falling in
consequence, the great store, and all its
hoarded treasures, appeared through
the chasm.</p>

<p>The Jew's instincts had, at first,
led him to save himself by flight.
But, on returning timorously to look
after his property, the sight of the
ruined wall, and the unprotected
hoards on which he had so securely
reckoned as the source of wealth,
obliterated in his mind, for the time,
all sense of personal danger. Seeing
a party of soldiers issuing from a wine-house
near, he eagerly besought them
to assist him in removing his property
to a place of safety, promising to reward
them largely for their risk and
trouble.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers thus appealed
to was Mr Bags.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" said Mr Bags; "here's
a chance&mdash;here's a pleasure, comrades.
We can help Mr Lazaro, who
is always so good to us&mdash;this here
Jewish gentleman, that gives such
liberal prices for our things. Certainly&mdash;we'll
remove 'em all, and not
charge him nothing. Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;ah!"
And, to give point to his irony, Mr
Bags distorted his face hideously, and
winked upon his friends.</p>

<p>The idea of giving Lazaro any
assistance was considered a capital
joke, and caused a great deal of mirth
as they walked towards the store, to
which the Jew eagerly led the way.</p>

<p>"If there's anything good to eat
or drink in the store, we may remove
some of it, though it won't be on our
backs, eh, boys?" said Bags, as he
stept in advance, over a heap of rubbish,
into the store.</p>

<p>"These first&mdash;these, my friends,"
cried the Jew, going up to a row of
barrels, standing a little apart from
the crowded masses of articles.</p>

<p>"Oh, these first, eh?" said Bags;
"they're the best, be they? Thank
you, Mr Lazaro; we'll see what's in
'em;" and, taking up a gimlet that
lay near, he proceeded to bore a hole
in one of the barrels, desiring a friend,
whom he addressed as Tim, to tap
the next one.</p>

<p>"Thieves!" screamed the Jew, on
witnessing this proceeding, seizing
Bags' arm, "leave my store&mdash;go out&mdash;let
my goods alone!" Bags lent
him a shove that sent him into a corner,
and perceiving liquor flowing
from the hole he had drilled, applied
his mouth to the orifice.</p>

<p>"Brandy," said he, as he paused
for breath, "real Cognac. Comrades,
here's luck to that 'ere shot that
showed us the way in;" and he took
another diligent pull at the hole.</p>

<p>Meantime his comrades had not
been idle; other barrels were opened,
and their contents submitted to a critical
inspection.</p>

<p>The Jew tried various modes to
induce them to relinquish their booty:
first threats&mdash;then offers of reward&mdash;then
cajolery; and, at last, attempted
to interpose and thrust them from
their spoil. A shot from the enemy
entering the store, enfiladed a long
line of barrels, scattering the staves
and their contents. The place was
instantly flooded with liquor&mdash;wine,
molasses, spirits, and oil, ran in a
mingled stream, soaking the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of
biscuit and salt provisions that strewed
the floor. One soldier was struck
dead, and Mr Bags only escaped destruction
by the lucky accident of
having his head at that moment apart
from the barrel which had engrossed
his attention, and which was knocked
to pieces.</p>

<p>The Jew, partly stunned by a
wound in the forehead from the
splinter of a barrel, and partly in
despair at the destruction of his property,
came to the entrance of the
store, seating himself among the
rubbish. Other plunderers speedily
followed the example of the marauding
soldiers, but he made no attempt
to stop them as they walked past him.
My grandfather, passing at the time
on his way home, was horrified at the
sight of him. Flour from a splintered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
barrel had been scattered over his
face, and blood from the wound in
his forehead, trickling down, had
clotted it on his cheeks and scanty
beard, giving him an aspect at
once appalling and disgusting. His
daughter had waited at the door of the
Fives' Court till she saw Owen come
forth in safety, and had then availed
herself of the protection of the Major
as far as her own home. Shrieking
at the dismal sight, she sprang forward
and threw herself before the
Jew, casting her arms around him.
This seemed to rouse him. He arose&mdash;looked
back into the store; and
then, as if goaded by the sight of the
wreck into intolerable anguish, he
lifted his clenched hands above his
head, uttering a sentence of such
fearful blasphemy, that a devout
Spaniard, who was emerging from
the store with some plunder, struck
him on the mouth. He never heeded
the blow, but continued to rave, till,
suddenly overcome by loss of blood
and impotent rage, he dropt senseless
on the ground.</p>

<p>My grandfather, calling some soldiers
of his regiment who were passing,
desired them to convey him to
the hospital at the South Barracks,
and, again taking the terrified and
weeping Esther under his protection,
followed to see the unfortunate
Jew cared for.</p>

<p>At the various parades that day
Mr Bags was reported absent, being
in fact engaged in pursuits of a much
more interesting nature than his military
duties. A vast field of interprise
was opened to him and other
adventurous spirits, of which they
did not fail to avail themselves, in the
quantity of property of all kinds
abandoned by the owners, in houses
and shops where locks and bolts were
no longer a protection; and although
the firing, which ceased for an hour
or two in the middle of the day, was
renewed towards evening and continued
with great fury, the ardour of
acquisition by no means abated.</p>

<p>About midnight a sentry on the
heights of Rosia (the name given to
a portion of the rugged cliffs towards
the south and near the hospital)
observed, in the gloom, a figure lurking
about one of the batteries, and
challenged it. Receiving no answer,
he threatened to fire, when Bags came
forward reluctantly, with a bundle in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Hush, Bill," said Bags, on finding
the sentry was a personal friend&mdash;"don't
make a row: it's only me,
Bags&mdash;Tongs, you know," he added,
to insure his recognition.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing
there, you fool?" asked his friend in
a surly tone&mdash;"don't you know the
picquet's after you?"</p>

<p>"I've got some little things here
that I want to lay by, where nobody
won't see 'em, in case I'm catched,"
returned Bags. "Don't you take no
notice of me, Bill, and I'll be off
directly."</p>

<p>"What have ye got?" asked Bill,
whose curiosity was awakened by the
proceedings of his friend.</p>

<p>"Some little matters that I picked
up in the town," returned Bags.
"Pity you should be on guard to-day,
Bill&mdash;there was some pretty pickings.
I'll save something for you, Bill,"
added Bags, in an unaccountable
access of generosity.</p>

<p>The sentry, however, who was a
person in every way worthy of the
friendship of Mr Bags, expressed no
gratitude for the considerate offer,
but began poking at the bundle with
his bayonet.</p>

<p>"Hands off, Bill," said Bags,
"they won't abear touching."</p>

<p>"Let's see 'em," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Not a bit on it," said Bags;
"they ain't aworth looking at."</p>

<p>"Suppose I was to call the sergeant
of the guard," said Bill.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't do such a action?"
said Bags, in a tone strongly expressive
of disgust at such baseness.
"No, no, Bill, you ain't that sort of
fellow, <em>I'm</em> sure."</p>

<p>"It's my dooty," said the sentry,
placing the butt of his musket on the
ground, and leaning his elbow on the
muzzle. "You see that what you
said, Tongs, was very true, about its
being hard upon me to be carrying
about this here damnable weppin"
(slapping the barrel of the musket)
"all day for fourpence ha'penny,
while you are making your fortin.
It is, Tongs, d&mdash;d hard."</p>

<p>"Never mind; there'll be plenty
left to-morrow," said Bags in a consolatory
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span></p>

<p>"What shall we say, now, if I lets
ye hide it?" said Bill, pointing to the
bundle. "Half-shares?"</p>

<p>"This ain't like a friend, Bill,"
returned Tongs, highly disgusted
with this ungenerous proposal. "Nobody
ever knowed me interfere with
a comrade when I was on sentry.
How long ago is it since I let ye stay
in my box an hour, till ye was sober
enough to walk into barracks, when
I was sentry at the gate? Why, the
whole bundle ain't worth eighteenpence&mdash;and
I've worked hard for
it."</p>

<p>"Half-shares?" reiterated Bill, not
melted in the least by the memory of
ancient benefits.</p>

<p>"No, by G&mdash;!" said Bags in great
wrath.</p>

<p>"Serg&mdash;&mdash;," began Bill in an elevated
voice, porting his arms at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Bags; "don't call
the sergeant. Half is better nor
nothing, if ye're going to behave like
that. We'll say half, then."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bill, returning to his
former position&mdash;"I thought we
should agree. And now let's see
'em, Tongs."</p>

<p>Muttering still his disapprobation
of this unworthy treatment, Bags
put his bundle on the stone embrasure
of the battery, and began to
unfold it.</p>

<p>Eighteenpence was certainly a low
valuation. Bags appeared to have
visited a jeweller's shop. Watches,
rings, bracelets, gold chains, and
brooches glittered on the dingy surface
of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"My eye!" said Bill, unable to
repress a low laugh of delight&mdash;"why,
we'll turn bankers when we've
sold 'em. Tongs and Co., eh?" said
Bill with considerable humour.</p>

<p>Bags, however, told him he was
altogether mistaken in his estimate&mdash;most
of the things were pinchbeck,
he said, and the stones all glass;
and, to save Bill any trouble, he
offered to dispose of them himself to
the best possible advantage, and
bring his partner his share of the
proceeds, which would certainly be
at least ninepence, and might perhaps
be half-a-dollar. This arrangement
did not, however, meet the approbation
of the astute William, who
insisted on dividing the spoils by lot.
But here, again, there was a slight
misunderstanding, for both fixed
their affections on a gigantic watch,
which never could have been got into
any modern pocket, and whose face
was ornamented with paintings from
the heathen mythology. Both of
them supposed, from the size and the
brilliancy of the colours, that this
must be of immense value. Finding
they were not likely to come to a
speedy arrangement on this point,
they agreed to postpone the division
of the spoils till morning.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye where to put it, Bags,"
said Bill. "These here guns in this
battery haven't been fired for years,
nor ain't likely to be, though they
loaded 'em the other day. Take out the
wad of this one, and put in the bundle."</p>

<p>Bags approved of the idea, withdrew
the wad from the muzzle of the
gun, put in the bundle as far as his
arm would reach, and then replaced
the wad.</p>

<p>"Honour bright?" said Bags, preparing
to depart.</p>

<p>"Honour bright," returned Bill;
and Bags disappeared.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he did not feel sufficient
confidence in his confederate's
integrity to justify his quitting the
place and leaving him to his own
devices. He thought Bill might
perhaps avail himself of his absence
to remove the treasure, or be guilty
of some other treachery. He therefore
crept back again softly, till he
got behind a crag from whence he
had a full view of the battery.</p>

<p>For some time Bill walked sternly
to and fro on his post. Bags observed,
however, that he always included the
gun where the deposit lay in his perambulations,
which became shorter
and shorter. At last he halted close
to it, laid down his musket against
the parapet, and, approaching the
muzzle of the gun, took out the wad.</p>

<p>At this moment a neighbouring
sentry gave an alarm. The guard
turned out, and Bill, hastily replacing
the wad, resumed his arms and
looked about for the cause of the
alarm. About a mile out in the bay
several red sparks were visible. As
he looked there were a corresponding
number of flashes, and then a whistling
of shot high overhead told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
the guns from which they had been
discharged had been laid too high.
The Spanish gunboats were attacking
the south.</p>

<p>The drums beat to arms, and in a
few minutes the battery was manned
with artillerymen. To the inconceivable
horror of Bags and Bill, the
whole of the guns in the battery were
altered in position, and a gunner took
post at the rear of each with a lighted
portfire. Then a flushed face might
be seen, by the blue light of the portfires,
rising from behind a neighbouring
piece of rock, the eyes staring, the
mouth open in agonised expectation.</p>

<p>"Number one&mdash;fire!" said the
officer in command, to the gunner in
rear of the gun in which Mr Bags
had invested his capital.</p>

<p>"No, no!" shouted Bags, rising
wildly from behind the rock.</p>

<p>The portfire touched the vent&mdash;there
was a discharge that seemed
to rend Mr Bags's heartstrings and
blow off the roof of his skull&mdash;and
the clever speculation on which he
had counted for making his fortune
ended, like many others, in smoke.
He gazed for a moment out in the
direction of the flash, as if he expected
to see the watches and rings
gleaming in the air; then he turned
and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>After a few ineffectual discharges,
the Spaniards seemed to become
aware of the badness of their aim,
and to take measures to amend it.
Several shot struck the hospital; and
some shells falling through the roof,
exploded in the very wards where
the sick lay. The unhappy Jew,
Lazaro, lying in a feverish and semi-delirious
state from his former hurt
and agitation, was again struck by a
splinter of a shell which burst in the
ward where the Major's care had
seen him deposited, blowing up the
ceiling and part of the wall. In the
midst of the confusion, the Jew,
frantic with terror, rushed unrestrained
from the building, followed
only by his daughter, who was
watching by his bed. He was not
missed for some time, and the attempts
to discover him, made after
his disappearance became known,
were of no avail. A neighbouring
sentry had seen a white figure, followed
by another crying after it,
dash across the road and disappear
in the bushes; but the search made
about the vicinity of the spot failed
in detecting any traces of them, and
those who troubled themselves to
think of the matter at all, surmised
that they had fallen into the
sea.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p>For some pages, my grandfather's
note-book is filled with memoranda of
singular casualties from the enemy's
shot, wonderful escapes, and hasty
moments of quietude and attempted
comfort snatched "even in the cannon's
mouth." The fire from the
Spanish batteries shortly reduced the
town to ruins, and the gunboats at
night precluded all hope of peace and
oblivion after the horrors of the day.
Dreams, in which these horrors were
reproduced, were interrupted by still
more frightful nocturnal realities. One
of the curious minor evils that my
grandfather notices, as resulting from
an incessant cannonade, to those not
engaged in it actively enough to withdraw
their attention from the noise,
is the extreme irritation produced by
its long continuance, amounting, in
persons of nervous and excitable
temperament, to positive exasperation.</p>

<p>Some of the numerous incidents he
chronicles are also recorded by Drinkwater,
especially that of a man who
recovered after being almost knocked
to pieces by the bursting of a shell.
"His head was terribly fractured, his
left arm broken in two places, one of
his legs shattered, the skin and
muscles torn off his right hand, the
middle finger broken to pieces, and
his whole body most severely bruised
and marked with gunpowder. He
presented so horrid an object to the
surgeons, that they had not the
smallest hopes of saving his life, and
were at a loss what part to attend
to first. He was that evening trepanned;
a few days afterwards his
leg was amputated, and other wounds
and fractures dressed. Being possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
of a most excellent constitution,
nature performed wonders in his
favour, and in eleven weeks the cure
was completely effected. His name,"
continues Mr Drinkwater, with what
might be deemed irony&mdash;if the worthy
historian ever indulged in that figure
of rhetoric&mdash;"is Donald Ross, and
he" (<em>i. e.</em> the remaining fragment of
the said Donald Ross) "now enjoys
his sovereign's bounty in a pension
of ninepence a-day for life." One
might almost suppose that Mr Hume
had some hand in affixing the gratuity;
but in those days there was a
king who knew not Joseph.</p>

<p>My grandfather appears to have
had also an adventure of his own.
During a cessation of the cannonade,
he was sitting one morning on a fragment
of rock, in the garden behind
his quarters, reading his favourite
author. The firing suddenly recommenced,
and a long-ranged shell,
striking the ground at some distance,
rolled towards him. He glanced
half-absently at the hissing missile;
and whether he actually did not for
a moment recollect its character, or
whether, as was often the case on
such occasions, the imminence of the
danger paralysed him, he sat immovably
watching it as it fizzed within a
couple of yards of him. Unquestionably
in another three seconds my
grandfather's earthly tabernacle would
have been resolved into its original
atoms, had not the intrepid Carlota
(who was standing near gathering
flowers to stick in her hair) darted on
him, and, seizing him by the arm,
dragged him behind a wall. They were
scarce under shelter when the shell
exploded&mdash;the shock laying them both
prostrate, though unhurt but for a
few bruises&mdash;while the stone on which
the Major had been sitting was
shivered to atoms. To the description
of this incident in the Major's
journal are appended a pious reflection
and a short thanksgiving, which,
being entirely of a personal nature, I
omit.</p>

<p>The stores landed from the fleet
were in a very precarious position.
Owing to the destruction of the
buildings, there were no means of
placing them where they might be
sheltered at once from the fire of the
enemy and from rain. Some were
piled under sails spread out as a sort
of roof to protect them, and some,
that were not likely to sustain immediate
injury from the damp air of
such a depository, were ordered to be
conveyed to St Michael's Cave.</p>

<p>This cave is one of the most curious
features of the Rock. Its mouth&mdash;an
inconsiderable opening in the slope of
the mountain&mdash;is situated many hundred
feet above the sea. Within, it
expands into a spacious hall, the roof,
invisible in the gloom, supported by
thick pillars formed by the petrified
droppings of the rock. From this
principal cavern numerous smaller
ones branch off, leading, by dark,
broken, and precipitous passages, to
unknown depths. Along one of
these, according to tradition, Governor
O'Hara advanced farther than
ever man had gone before, and left
his sword in the inmost recess to be
recovered by the next explorer who
should be equally adventurous. But
whether it is that the tradition is unfounded,
or that the weapon has been
carried off by some gnome, or that
the governor's exploit is as yet unrivalled,
the sword has never been
brought to light.</p>

<p>For the duty of placing the stores
here, the name of Lieutenant Owen
appeared in the garrison orders. My
grandfather having nothing particular
to do, and being anxious to escape as
much as possible for a short time from
the din of the bombardment, offered
to accompany Frank in the execution
of this duty.</p>

<p>The day was dark and gloomy, and
the steep path slippery from rain, so
that the mules bearing the stores
toiled with difficulty up the ascent.
At first, my grandfather and Owen
indulged in cheerful conversation; but
shortness of breath soon reduced the
Major to monosyllables, and the latter
part of the journey was accomplished
in silence. Frequently the Major
paused and faced about, at once to
look at the prospect and to take
breath. Far below, on his right, was
seen the southern end of the town,
consisting partly of a heap of ruins,
with here and there a rafter sticking
out of the mass, partly of roofless
walls, among which was occasionally
heard the crashing of shot; but the
guns that discharged them, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
those that replied from the town, were
invisible from this point. Directly
beneath him the ground afforded a
curious spectacle, being covered with
tents, huts, and sheds, of all sorts
and sizes, where the outcast population
of the ruined town obtained a
precarious and insufficient shelter.
The only building visible which still
retained its former appearance was
the convent&mdash;the governor's residence&mdash;which
was protected by bomb-proofs,
and where working-parties
were constantly engaged in repairing
the injuries. The bay, once thickly
wooded with masts and dotted with
sails, was now blank and cheerless;
only the enemy's cruisers were visible,
lying under the opposite shore of
Spain.</p>

<p>Owen and my grandfather arrived
at the mouth of the cave somewhat
in advance of the convoy. To their
surprise a smoke was issuing from it;
and, as they approached nearer, their
nostrils were greeted by an odour at
once savoury and spicy. Going softly
up they looked in.</p>

<p>Mr Bags and a couple of friends
were seated round a fire, over which
was roasting a small pig, scientifically
butchered and deprived of his hair,
and hung up by the heels. The fire,
in the absence of other fuel, (of which
there was an extreme scarcity in
Gibraltar,) was supplied by bundles
of cinnamon plundered from the store
of some grocer, and, as the flame
waxed low, Mr Bags took a fresh
bundle from a heap of that fragrant
spice by his side, and laid it on the
embers. Mrs Bags was occupied in
basting the pig with lard, which she
administered from time to time with
an iron ladle.</p>

<p>Presently Mr Bags tapped on the
pig's back with his knife. It sent
forth a crisp crackling sound, that
made my grandfather's mouth water,
and caused Mr Bags to become impatient.</p>

<p>"Polly," said he, "it's my opinion
it's been done these three minutes.
I can't wait much longer."</p>

<p>And he cast a glance at the other
two soldiers, (in whom, as well as in
Bags, Owen recognised men of his
company who had been reported absent
for some days, and were supposed
to have gone over to the enemy,)
to ascertain if their opinions tallied
with his own on this point.</p>

<p>"It can't be no better," said one,
taking hold of the pig's neck between
his finger and thumb, which he afterwards
applied to his mouth.</p>

<p>"I can't abear my meat overdone,"
said the third. "What I say is, let
them that likes to wait, wait, and let
them that wants to begin, begin." So
saying, he rose, and was about to attack
the ribs of the porker with his
knife.</p>

<p>"Do stop a minute&mdash;that's a dear,"
said Mrs Bags; "another bundle of
cinnament will make it parfect. I'll
give ye something to stay your
stomach;" and stepping to a nook
in the wall of the cavern, where stood
a large barrel, she filled a pewter
measure, and handed it to the impatient
advocate for underdone pork,
who took a considerable dram, and
passed it to his companions.</p>

<p>"Cinnament's better with pork
nor with most things," said Bags.
"It spoils goose, because it don't
agree with the inions, and it makes
fowls wishy-washy; but it goes excellent
with pig."</p>

<p>"What's left in the larder?" asked
one of the party.</p>

<p>"There's a week's good eating yet,"
said Mrs Bags, "and we <em>might</em> make
it do ten days or a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Well!" said the other, "they
may say what they like about sieges,
but this is the jolliest time ever <em>I</em> had."</p>

<p>"It's very well by day," said Bags,
"but the nights is cold, and the company
of that ghost ain't agreeable&mdash;I
seed it again last night."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said his friend, "what
was it like, Tongs?"</p>

<p>"Something white," returned Bags
in an awful whisper, "with a ghost's
eyes. You may allays know a ghost
by the eyes. I was just rising up,
and thinking about getting a drink,
for my coppers was hot, when it
comes gliding up from that end of the
cave. I spoke to you, and then I
couldn't see it no more, because it
was varnished."</p>

<p>"Ghosts always varnishes if you
speak," said Mrs Bags. "But never
mind the spirit now&mdash;let's look after
the flesh," added the lady, who possessed
a fund of native pleasantry:
"the pig's done to a turn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>At this interesting juncture, and
just as they were about to fall to, the
footsteps of the approaching mules
struck on their ears. Owen went to
meet the party, and hastily selecting
six men from it, advanced, and desired
them to secure the astounded
convivialists.</p>

<p>On recovering from their first astonishment,
Bags begged Owen would
overlook the offence; they were only,
he pleaded, having a little spree&mdash;times
had been hard lately. Mrs
Bags, as usual, displayed great eloquence,
though not much to the purpose.
She seemed to have some idea
that an enumeration of the gentlemen's
families she had lived in, and
the high estimation in which she had
been held in all, would really tell
powerfully in favour of the delinquents,
and persevered accordingly,
till they were marched off in custody
of the escort, when she made a final
appeal to my grandfather, as the last
gentleman whose family she had lived
in&mdash;with what advantage to the
household the reader knows. The
Major, who could not forgive the
roasting of his ham, called her, in reply,
a "horrible woman," but, at the
same time, whispered to Owen that
he hoped the fellows would not be
severely punished. "If we had
caught them after dinner," said he, "I
shouldn't have pitied them so much."</p>

<p>"Never mind them," said Owen;
"let us proceed to business. We
must select the driest spot we can find
to put the stores in."</p>

<p>[Here, by way of taking leave of
Mr Bags, I may remark, that he narrowly
escaped being hanged as a
plunderer&mdash;failing which, he was sentenced
by a court-martial to receive
a number of lashes, which I refrain
from specifying, because it would certainly
make the hair of a modern
humanitarian turn white with horror.]</p>

<p>"Come along, Major," said Owen;
"perhaps we may find more of these
scoundrels in the course of our researches."</p>

<p>The Major did not move; he was
earnestly regarding the carcase of the
pig, that steamed hissing above the
embers.</p>

<p>"Queer idea that of the cinnamon
fire," said he. "I wonder how the
meat tastes."</p>

<p>Owen did not hear him, having
walked forward.</p>

<p>"Have you got a knife about you,
Frank?" said the Major. "Do you
know I have a curious desire to ascertain
the flavour. It may be a feature
in cookery worth knowing."</p>

<p>Owen had not a knife, nor had
any of the men, but one of them suggested
that the Major's sword would
answer the purpose.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the Major. "A
good idea! I don't see why swords
shouldn't be turned into carving-knives
as well as into pruning-hooks."
So saying, he drew it from the sheath,
and, straddling across the fire, detached
a crisp brown mouthful from
the pig's ribs, and putting a little
salt on it, he conveyed it to his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried the Major.
"I give you my word of honour,
Owen, 'tis excellent! The cinnamon
gives it a sort of a &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here a second and larger mouthful
interrupted the criticism.</p>

<p>"It must be very near lunch-time,"
said the Major, pausing, sword in
hand, when he had swallowed it;
then, pretending to look at his watch&mdash;"Bless
me, it only wants half-an-hour
of it. Do you think this business
will take you long, Owen?"</p>

<p>"About a couple of hours," said
Owen.</p>

<p>"Ah, why, there you see," returned
the Major, "we shan't get home till
long past lunch-time. I really don't
see why we shouldn't take a snack
now. Nothing can be better than
that pig. I only wish the woman
had dressed my dinner half as well.
Corporal Hodson, would you oblige
me with a piece of that biscuit near
you?" And, detaching a large fragment
of pork, he placed it on the
biscuit, and sprinkling it with pepper
and salt, which condiments had not
been forgotten in the gastronomic arrangements
of Mr Bags, he proceeded
to follow Owen into the interior of
the cave, taking huge bites as he
went.</p>

<p>The path slopes at first steeply
downward from the mouth to the interior
of the cavern, where it becomes
more level. Light being admitted
only at the entrance, the gloom of the
interior is almost impenetrable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
eye. The men had brought torches
to assist them in their work, and, a
suitable spot having been selected,
these were stuck on different points
and abutments of the rocky wall,
when the party proceeded to unload
the mules at the entrance, conveying
their burdens into the cave.</p>

<p>In the midst of the bustle and noise
attending the operation, the little dog
given by Esther to Carlota, which
had that morning followed the Major,
to whom it had speedily attached itself,
began barking and howling dismally
in a dark recess behind one of
the great natural pillars before spoken
of. As the noise continued, intermixed
with piteous whinings, one of
the men took a torch from the wall,
and stepped forward into the darkness,
to see what ailed the animal.
Presently he cried out that "there
was a man there."</p>

<p>My grandfather, who was next
him, immediately followed, and five
paces brought him to the spot. The
soldier who held the torch was stooping,
and holding it over a figure that
lay on the ground on its back. In the
unshaven, blood-stained countenance,
my grandfather, at first, had some
difficulty in recognising Lazaro the
Jew. Some fiery splashes of pitch
from the torch dropping at the moment
on his bare throat, produced no
movement, though, had he been living,
they must have scorched him to
the quick.</p>

<p>On the body was nothing but the
shirt he wore the night of his flight
from the hospital, but his legs were
wrapt in a woman's dress. Across
his breast, on her face, lay Esther, in
her white under-garments&mdash;for the
gown that wrapt the Jew's legs was
hers. The glare of the torch was
bright and red on the two prostrate
figures, and on the staring appalled
countenance of the man who held it&mdash;the
group forming a glowing spot in
the vast, sombre, vaulted space, where
dim gleams of light were caught and
repeated on projecting masses of rock,
more and more faintly, till all was
bounded by darkness.</p>

<p>Years afterwards my grandfather
would sometimes complain of having
been revisited, in dreams of the night,
by that ghastly piece of Rembrandt
painting.</p>

<p>The rest quickly flocked to the spot,
and Esther was lifted and found to
breathe, though the Jew was stiff and
cold. Some diluted spirit, from the
cellar of Bags, being poured down her
throat she revived a little, when my
grandfather caused two of the men to
bear her carefully to his house; and
the body of the Jew being wrapt in a
piece of canvass, was placed on a
mule and conveyed to the hospital
for interment.</p>

<p>Medical aid restored Esther to consciousness,
and she told how they
came to be found in the cave.</p>

<p>Her father, on leaving the hospital,
had fled by chance, as she thought,
to this cave, for he did not reach it by
the usual path, but climbed, in his
delirious fear, up the face of the rock,
and she had followed him as well as
she could, keeping his white figure in
sight. They had both lain exhausted
in the cave till morning, when, finding
that her father slept, she was on the
point of leaving him to seek assistance.
But, unhappily, before she
could quit the place, Bags and his
associates entered from their plundering
expedition into the town, and,
frightened at their drunken language,
and recognising in Bags the man who
had robbed her, she had crept back to
her concealment. The party of marauders
never quitted the cavern from
the moment of establishing themselves
in it. They spent the day in eating,
drinking, singing songs, and sometimes
quarrelling. Twice, at night,
she ventured forth; but she always
found one of them asleep across the
entrance, so that she could not pass
without waking him, and once one of
them started up, and seemed about to
pursue her&mdash;doubtless Bags, on the
occasion when he thought he saw a
ghost. Nevertheless, she had mustered
courage twice to take some fragments
of food that were lying near
the fire, leaving each time a piece of
money in payment; and she had also
taken a lighted candle, the better to
ascertain her father's situation. He
had never spoken to her since the first
night of their coming, and, during all
those dark and weary hours, (for they
were three nights and two days in
the cavern,) she had remained by
him listening to his incoherent mutterings
and moans. The candle had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
showed her that he had lost much
blood, from the wound in his forehead
breaking out afresh, as well as
from the other received in the hospital,
though the latter was but a flesh
wound. These she had bandaged with
shreds of her dress, and had tried to
give him some of the nourishment she
had procured, but could force nothing
on him except some water. Some
hours, however&mdash;how long she did not
know, but it was during the night&mdash;before
Owen's party found her, the
Jew had become sensible. He told
her he was dying; and, unconscious of
where he was, desired her to fetch a
light. This she had procured in the
same way as before, lighting the
candle at the embers of the fire round
which Bags and his friends reposed.
Then the Jew, who seemed to imagine
himself still in the hospital, bid her
say whom, among those she knew in
Gibraltar, she would wish to have
charge of her when he was no more;
and, on her mentioning Carlota, had
desired her to take pen and paper and
write his will as he should dictate it.
Pen she had none, but she had a
pencil and a scrap of paper in her
pocket, and with these she wrote,
leaning over to catch the whispered
syllables that he with difficulty articulated.</p>

<p>From this paper it would appear
that the Jew had some fatherly feelings
for Esther concealed beneath his
harsh deportment towards her. I can
describe the will, for I have often seen
it. It is written on a piece of crumpled
writing-paper, about the size of a bank-note,
very stained and dirty. It is
written in Spanish; and in it the Jew
entreats "the Señora, the wife of Sr.
Don Flinder, English officer, to take
charge of his orphan child, in requital
whereof he leaves her the half of whatsoever
property he dies possessed of,
the other half to be disposed of for the
benefit of his daughter." Then follows
a second paragraph, inserted at Esther's
own desire, to the effect that,
should she not survive, the whole was
to be inherited by the aforesaid Señora.
It is dated "Abril 1781," and signed
in a faint, straggling hand, quite
different from the clear writing of the
rest&mdash;"<span class="smcap">José Lazaro</span>."</p>

<p>Esther would now have gone, at all
hazards, to obtain assistance, but the
Jew clutched her arm, and would not
permit her to quit him. He breathed
his last shortly after, and Esther
remembered nothing more till she
came to herself in the Major's house.
The paper was found in her bosom.</p>

<p>Some days after this event my
grandfather went with Owen into the
town, during a temporary lull in the
enemy's firing, to visit the house of
Lazaro, in order to ascertain whether
anything valuable was left that might
be converted to Esther's benefit.
They had some difficulty in finding
the exact locality, owing to the utter
destruction of all the landmarks. The
place was a mass of ruins. Some
provisions and goods had been left by
the plunderers, but so mixed with
rubbish, and overflowed with the
contents of the casks of liquor and
molasses, as to be of no value even in
these times of dearth.</p>

<p>Owen, poking about among the
wreck, observed an open space in the
middle of one of the shattered walls,
as if something had been built into it.
With the assistance of my grandfather's
cane, he succeeded in dislodging
the surrounding masonry, already
loosened by shot, and they discovered
it to be a recess made in the
thickness of the wall, and closed by a
small iron door. At the bottom was
lying a small box, also of iron, which
they raised, not without difficulty, for
its weight was extraordinary in proportion
to its dimensions. This being
conveyed to my grandfather's, and
opened, was found to contain more
than six hundred doubloons, (a sum
in value about two thousand pounds,)
and many bills of exchange and promissory
notes, mostly those of officers.
The latest was that of Von Dessel.
These the Major, by Esther's desire,
returned to the persons whose signatures
they bore.</p>

<p>Esther never completely recovered
from the effects of her sojourn in the
cave, but remained always pale and
of weak health. My grandfather took
good care of her inheritance for her,
and on leaving Gibraltar, at the conclusion
of the siege, invested the
whole of it safely for her benefit,
placing her, at the same time, in the
family of some respectable persons of
her own religion. She afterwards
married a wealthy Hebrew; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
whatever part of the world the Major
chanced to be serving, so long as she
lived, valuable presents would constantly
arrive from Gibraltar&mdash;mantillas
and ornaments of jewellery for
Carlota, and butts of delicious sherry
for my grandfather. These, however,
ceased with her death, about twenty
years afterwards.</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the most connected
and interesting episode to be
found in the Major's note-book; and
it is, I think, the last specimen I shall
offer of these new "Tales of my
Grandfather."</p>

<p>As a child I used to listen, with
interest ever new, to the tale of the
young Jewess, which the narrator
had often heard from the lips of Carlota
and her husband. St Michael's
Cave took rank in my mind with those
other subterranean abodes where Cassim,
the brother of Ali Baba, who
forgot the word "<em>Open Sesame</em>,"
was murdered by the Forty Thieves;
where Aladdin was shut by the magician
in the enchanted garden; and
where Robinson Crusoe discovered
the dying he-goat. And when, at the
conclusion of the tale, the scrap of
paper containing the Jew's will was
produced from a certain desk, and
carefully unfolded, I seemed to be connected
by some awful and mysterious
link with these departed actors in the
scenes I had so breathlessly listened to.</p>

<h2>LIFE AMONGST THE LOGGERS.</h2>

<p><em>Forest Life and Forest Trees.</em> By <span class="smcap">John S. Springer</span>. New York: Harper.
London: Sampson Low. 1851.</p>


<p>The northern and elder States of
the great American Union have ceased
to be associated in our minds with
those ideas of wild and romantic adventure
which are inseparably connected
with some of their younger
brethren far west and south. There
is nothing suggestive of romance in
such names as New York, Maine,
and Pennsylvania: cotton bales, keen
traders and repudiated debts, drab
coats, wooden clocks, and counterfeit
nutmegs, compose the equivocal and
unpoetical visions they conjure up to
European imaginations. But drop we
our eyes down the map to lawless
Arkansas, feverish Louisiana, and
debateable Texas, or westwards to
the still newer State of California, and
a host of stirring and picturesque associations
throng upon our memory.
Strange scenes and a motley array
pass before us. Bands of hunters and
trappers, scarce more civilised than
the Indians with whom they war, or
gentler than the buffalo which yields
them sport and food; predatory armies,
for Mexico bound, keen for spoil and
regardless of right; caravans of adventurous
gold-seekers braving the
perilous passage of the Rocky Mountains;
hardy squatters, axe in hand,
hewing themselves a home in the heart
of the wilderness; innumerable traits
of courage and endurance&mdash;incredible
sufferings and countless crimes&mdash;make
up a picture-gallery unrivalled of its
kind. In those districts, not a league
of prairie, not a mountain or stream,
not a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bayou</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barranca</i>, but has
derived recent and vivid interest from
the animated sketches of Sealsfield,
Ruxton, Wise, and a host of other
graphic and vigorous delineators.</p>

<p>As if to vindicate the claims to interest
of the northern American provinces,
a Down-easter, Springer by
name, who hails from the State of
Maine, has exhibited, in a curious little
volume, the adventurous side of life in
<em>his</em> part of the Union. At a first
glance, there would appear to be few
created things whose history was
likely to be less interesting than that
of a Yankee pine-log. Get astride it
with Springer, and paddle up the
Penobscot, clearing rapids and other
impediments as best you may on so
unpromising a float&mdash;and, before
reaching the place where it grew, you
shall marvel at the skill and daring
expended, and at the risks run to
procure it. Springer, who was reared
amongst the pine forests, which his
axe afterwards helped to thin, is an
enthusiastic woodsman, and feels
"kinder jealous" that whilst the
habits and adventures of many classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
of his countrymen have occupied skilful
writers and public attention, no
chronicler should have been found for
the deeds and perils of that numerous
class to which he for some years
belonged. To supply this deficiency,
he himself, although more used to
handle axe than goose-quill, has written
a plain and unpretending account
of scenes and incidents which he
shared in and witnessed. The freshness
of the subject, and the honest
earnestness of the man, would atone
for clumsier treatment than it has
met with at his hands.</p>

<p>The second title of Mr Springer's
book gives a clearer idea of its contents
than the primary one. The
volume comprises, says the title-page,
"Winter camp-life, among the Loggers,
and wild-wood adventure, with descriptions
of lumbering operations on
the various rivers of Maine and New
Brunswick." It is divided into three
parts; the first and shortest being a
dissertation on forest trees, with particular
reference to those of America;
the second, entitled "The Pine Tree,
or Forest Life," giving an account of
wood-cutting operations; the third,
"River Life," detailing the progress
of the timber from the forest to the
"boom," or depôt. The chief interest
of the book begins with the second
chapter of the second part, wherein is
described the commencement of the
labours of a gang of "loggers," or
woodcutters. In the hunt after
timber, as after certain animals, the
first thing to be done is to mark the
whereabout of your game preparatory
to starting in its pursuit. On the eve
of the chase the keeper reconnoitres
the retreat of the wild-boar. Before
a party of loggers proceed to establish
a camp and pass the winter woodcutting,
they send out scouts to ascertain
where timber is plenty.
Thirty years since, this was scarcely
necessary&mdash;the pine, that forest king
of the northern States, abounded on
every side. Fifty years hence&mdash;so it
is estimated by those best qualified to
judge&mdash;the vast pine forests, through
which the Penobscot flows, will be on
the eve of extinction. Now is the
intermediate stage. A man cannot,
as he formerly could, step from his
house to his day's work; but research
and labour still command a rich
timber harvest. Exploring expeditions
may be made at any period of
the year, but autumn is the favourite
season. They consist generally of
only two or three men, accustomed to
the business, who, provided with the
necessary provisions, with a coffee-pot
and a blanket, axe, rifle, and
ammunition, embark on skiff or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bateau</i>, and pole and paddle their way
two hundred miles or more up the
Penobscot or the St Croix, and their
numerous tributaries. On reaching
the district it is proposed to explore,
the boat is hauled ashore and turned
bottom upwards, the load of stores is
divided amongst the party, and they
strike into the forest, rousing, on their
passage, the stately moose, the timid
deer, the roaming black bear, and
many an inferior denizen of the lonesome
wilderness. They now begin
"prospecting." Often the thickness
of the forest and the uneven surface
of the country prevent their obtaining
a sufficiently extensive view, and
compel them to climb trees in order
to look around them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When an ascent is to be made, the
spruce tree is generally selected, principally
for the superior facilities which its
numerous limbs afford the climber. To
gain the first limbs of this tree, which are
from twenty to forty feet from the ground,
a smaller tree is undercut and lodged
against it, clambering up which the top
of the spruce is reached. Sometimes,
when a very elevated position is desired,
the spruce tree is lodged against the
trunk of some lofty pine, up which we
ascend to a height twice that of the
surrounding forest. From such a tree-top,
like a mariner at the mast-head upon
the look-out for whales, (and indeed the
pine is the whale of the forest,) large
'clumps' and 'veins' of pine are discovered,
whose towering tops may be
seen for miles around. Such views fill
the bosom of timber-hunters with an
<em>intense interest</em>. They are the object of his
search&mdash;his treasure, his Eldorado; and
they are beheld with peculiar and thrilling
emotions. To detail the process more
minutely, we should observe, that the
man in the tree-top points out the direction
in which the pines are seen; or, if
hid from the view of those below by the
surrounding foliage, he breaks a small
limb, and throws it in the direction in
which they appear, whilst a man at the
base marks the direction indicated by the
falling limb by means of a compass which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
he holds in his hand, the compass being
quite as necessary in the wilderness as on
the pathless ocean. In fair weather the
sun serves as an important guide; and in
cloudy weather the close observation of
an experienced woodman will enable him
to steer a tolerably correct course by the
moss which grows on the trunks of most
hardwood trees, the north sides of which
are covered with a much larger share
than the other portions of the trunk.
This Indian compass, however, is not very
convenient or safe, particularly in passing
through swampy lands, which are of
frequent occurrence."</p></blockquote>

<p>Two reflections are suggested by
the paragraph we have just copied.
The substance of one of them is noted
in the Preface. "This volume," says
the modest and sensible Springer,
"makes no pretensions to literary
merit; sooner would it claim kindred
with the wild and uncultivated scenes
of which it is but a simple relation."
The second reflection is, that our
wood-cutter is an enthusiast in his
craft; for wood-cutting in Maine <em>is</em> a
craft, and no common log-chopping.
To Springer, a towering grove of
timber is as exciting a sight as is to
the hunter that of a herd of antlered
deer or shaggy buffalo. The pine
especially is the object of his love and
admiration. He abounds in anecdotes
and arguments to prove its good
qualities, and labours hard to establish
its superiority to the oak. Reared
amongst the noble pines of Maine, he
says, even as a child, he could never
hear, without feelings of jealousy,
the oak extolled as monarch of the
forest. Admitting it to excel in
strength, he vaunts, upon the other
hand, the superior grandeur and girth
of the pine, its value in building, the
breadth of its planks, their clearness,
beauty, and freedom from knots, the
numerous uses to which it is applicable,
its excellence as fuel, its perfect adaptation
to all the joiner's purposes.
He extols in turn each of its varieties;
the red pine, remarkable for its tall
trunk, which sometimes rises eighty
feet from the ground before putting
out a limb; the pitch pine, inferior in
size, but preferable to any other wood
for generating steam in engines; the
white pine, superior to all in value
and dimensions. He tells us of pines,
of which he has read or heard, of
extraordinary grandeur and diameter:
of one, two hundred and sixty-four
feet long; and of another which, at
three feet from the ground, was fifty-seven
feet nine inches in circumference.
These extraordinary specimens were
cut some years ago. Trees of such
dimensions are now rare.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have worked in the forests among
this timber several years," says Springer,
"have cut many hundreds of trees, and
seen many thousands, but I never found
one larger than one I felled on a little
stream which empties into Jackson Lake,
near the head of Baskahegan stream, in
eastern Maine. This was a pumpkin
pine, (a variety of the white pine.) Its
trunk was as straight and handsomely
grown as a moulded candle, and measured
six feet in diameter four feet from the
ground, without the aid of spur roots.
It was about nine rods in length, or one
hundred and forty-four feet, about sixty-five
feet of which was free of limbs, and
retained its diameter remarkably well.
I was employed about one hour and a
quarter in felling it. The afternoon was
beautiful; everything was calm, and to
me the circumstances were deeply interesting.
After chopping an hour or so,
the mighty giant, the growth of centuries,
which had withstood the hurricane, and
raised itself in peerless majesty above all
around, began to tremble under the
strokes of a mere insect, as I might appear
in comparison with it. My heart palpitated
as I occasionally raised my eye to
its pinnacle to catch the first indications
of its fall. It came down at length with
a crash, which seemed to shake a hundred
acres, whilst the loud echo rang through
the forest, dying away amongst the distant
hills. It had a hollow in the butt about the
size of a barrel, and the surface of the
stump was sufficiently spacious to allow
a yoke of oxen to stand upon it. It made
five logs, and loaded a six-ox team three
times. The butt-log was so large, that
the stream did not float it in the spring;
and when the drive was taken down, we
were obliged to leave it behind, much to
our regret and loss. At the boom, that
log would have been worth fifty dollars."</p></blockquote>

<p>The pine tracts ascertained, the
quality of the trees examined, the
distance the timber will have to be
hauled duly calculated, and the ground
inspected, through which logging
roads must be cut, the exploring
party retrace their steps to the place
where they left their boat. Foot-sore
with their forest roamings, they gladly
look forward to the quick, gliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
passage down stream. A grievous
disappointment sometimes awaits
them. In the fall of the year, the
black bear is seized with a violent
longing for pitch and resinous substances,
and frequently strips fir trees
of their bark for the sake of the exudations.
Occasionally he stumbles
over a timber-hunter's <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bateau</i>, and
tears it to pieces in the course of the
rough process he employs to extract
the tar from its planks. If it is injured
beyond possibility of repair,
the unlucky pioneers have to perform
their homeward journey on foot, unless
indeed they are so fortunate as to
fall in with some Indian trapper,
whose canoe they can charter for a
portion of the way. Once at home,
the next step is to obtain permits
from the State or proprietors, securing,
at a stipulated price of so much per
thousand feet, the exclusive right to
cut timber within certain bounds.
Then comes haymaking&mdash;a most
important part of the loggers' duty;
for on nothing does the success of the
wood-cutting campaign depend more
than on the good working condition of
the sturdy teams of oxen which drag the
logs from the snow-covered forest to
the river's brink. Hard by the forest
extensive strips of meadow-land are
commonly found, covered with a
heavy growth of grass, and thither
large bands of men repair to make
and stalk the hay for the ensuing
winter's consumption. The labour of
haymaking in these upland meadows
of Maine is rendered intolerably
painful by the assaults of flies and
mosquitoes, and especially by the insidious
attacks of millions of midges,
so small as to be scarcely perceptible
to the naked eye, and which get between
the clothes and the skin, causing
a smarting and irritation so great as
to impede the progress of the work.
The torment of these insect attacks
is hardly compensated by the pastimes
and adventures incidental to the
occupation. Now and then a shot is
to be had at a stray deer; the streams
swarm with beautiful trout and
pickerel; skirmishes with black bears
are of frequent occurrence. Mr
Springer's volume abounds with stories
of encounters with bears, wolves, and
"Indian devils"&mdash;a formidable species
of catamount, of which the Indians
stand in particular dread. Although
the bear rarely shows himself pugnacious
unless assailed, his meddlesome,
thievish propensities render
him particularly obnoxious to the
hay-makers and wood-cutters; and
when they meet him, they never can
abstain from the aggressive, however
civilly Bruin may be disposed to pass
them by.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On one occasion," says Mr Springer,
"two men, crossing a small lake in
skiff, on their return from putting up hay,
discovered a bear swimming from a point
of land for the opposite shore. As usual
in such cases, temptation silenced prudence&mdash;they
changed their course, and
gave chase. The craft being light, they
gained fast upon the bear, who exerted
himself to the utmost to gain the shore;
but, finding himself an unequal match in
the race, he turned upon his pursuers,
and swam to meet them. One of the
men, a short, thick-set, dare-devil fellow,
seized an axe, and, the moment the bear
came up, inflicted a blow upon his head.
It seemed to make but a slight impression,
and before it could be repeated the
bear clambered into the boat. He instantly
grappled the man who struck
him, firmly setting his teeth in his thigh;
then, settling back upon his haunches, he
raised his victim in the air, and shook him
as a dog would a wood-chuck. The man at
the helm stood for a moment in amazement,
without knowing how to act, and fearing
that the bear might spring overboard and
drown his companion; but, recollecting
the effect of a blow upon the end of a
bear's snout, he struck him with a short
setting-pole. The bear dropped his victim
into the bottom of the boat, sallied
and fell overboard, and swam again for
the shore. The man bled freely from the
bite, and, as the wound proved too serious
to allow a renewal of the encounter,
they made for the shore. But one thing
saved them from being upset: the water
proved sufficiently shoal to admit of the
bear's getting bottom, from which he
sprang into the boat. Had the water
been deep, the consequences might have
been more serious."</p></blockquote>

<p>From its first to its last stage, the
logger's occupation is one of severe
toil and frequent peril. When the
pioneer's duty is accomplished, and
when the hay is made, there is still
hard work to be done before he can
begin to level the forest giants. No
kind of labour, Mr Springer assures
us, tests a man's physical abilities
and powers of endurance more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
boating supplies up river. The wood-cutters
come to a fall, and have to
land their implements and provisions,
and to carry them past it. Their
boats, too, must be carried, and that
over rocks and fallen trees, through
thickets and pathless swamps. Then
they come to rapids, up which they
have to pole their heavy-laden
bateaux. For this work, prodigious
skill, nerve, and strength are requisite.
Then come the long portages
from lake to lake, and the danger
of being swamped, when traversing
these, by sudden gusts of wind lashing
the lake, in a few minutes' time,
into foaming waves, in which the
deeply-loaded boats could not for a
moment live.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our frail skiff was about eighteen
feet long, and four feet across the top of
the gunwale amidships, tapering to a
point at either end, constructed of thin
slips of pine boards, nailed to some half-dozen
pair of slender knees, about two
inches in diameter. On board were fifteen
hundred pounds of provisions, with seven
men, which pressed her into the water
nearly to the gunwale; three inches
from the position of a level, and she
would fill with water."</p></blockquote>

<p>In such an overburthened cockle-shell
as this did Mr Springer once
find himself in company with a
drunken man, who was only withheld
from capsizing the boat by the threat
of having his skull split with a paddle;
for an inordinate addiction to rum is
the loggers' chief vice, a vice palliated
by the hardship and exposure they
endure. Drinking, however, is on
the decline amongst them of late
years, since "it has been fully demonstrated
that men can endure the
chilling hardships of river-driving
quite as well, and indeed far better,
without the stimulus of ardent spirits,
and perform more and better-directed
labour." Black pepper tea is drunk
on cold nights when camping in the
open air, and is found a warming and
comfortable beverage. Both in drink
and diet the loggers look more to
strength than to delicacy. Salt pork,
ship bread, and molasses, compose the
staple of their consumption. The
drippings from a slice of pork, roasted
before the fire, are allowed to fall on
the bread, which is then dignified by
the name of buttered toast. Sometimes
the salt pork is eaten raw,
dipped in molasses,&mdash;a mixture unequalled
for nastiness, we should
imagine, excepting by that of oysters
and brown sugar. "The recital may
cause," says honest Springer in his
comical English, "in delicate and
pampered stomachs some qualms, yet
we can assure the uninitiated that,
from these gross samples, the hungry
woodsman makes many a delicious
meal." An assurance which gives us
a most exalted idea of the appetite
and digestion of the loggers of
Maine.</p>

<p>Once in the forest with their stores,
the woodmen carefully select a suitable
spot, clear the ground, build
their "camp" and "hovel," and
commence their winter's work. The
"camp" and "hovel" are two log-houses,
the former being for the men,
the latter for the oxen. In some
respects the beasts are better treated
than their masters, for their hovel is
floored with small poles, a luxury
unknown in the camp, where the men
sleep on branches strewn upon the
bare earth. "Having completed our
winter residences, next in order comes
the business of looking out and cutting
the 'main' and some of the
principal 'branch roads.' These
roads, like the veins in the human
body, ramify the wilderness to all the
principal 'clumps' and 'groves' of
pine embraced in the permit." Mr
Springer expatiates on the graceful
curves of the roads, whose inequalities
soon become filled with snow,
and their surface hard-beaten and
glassy, polished by the sled and logs
which are continually passing over it,
whilst overhead the trees interlace
their spreading branches. "Along
this roadside, on the way to the landing,
runs a serpentine path for the
'knight of the goad,' whose deviations
are marked now outside this
tree, then behind that 'windfall,' now
again intercepting the main road,
skipping along like a dog at one's
side." The teamster, if he does his
duty, works harder than any man in
camp. Under a good teamster, the
oxen receive care almost as tender as
though they were race-horses with
thousands depending on their health
and condition. With proper attention
and management, they should be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
as good flesh in the spring as when
they began hauling early in winter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The last thing at night before 'turning
in,' the teamster lights his lantern
and repairs to the ox-hovel. In the
morning, by peep of day, and often before,
his visits are repeated, to hay and
provender, and card, and yoke up. While
the rest of the hands are sitting or lounging
around the liberal fire, shifting for
their comfort, after exposure to the winter
frosts through the day, he must repeatedly
go out to look after the comfort
of the sturdy, faithful ox. And then, for
an hour or two in the morning again,
whilst all, save the cook, are closing up
the sweet and unbroken slumbers of the
night, so welcome and necessary to the
labourer, he is out amid the early frost
with, I had almost said, the care of a
mother, to see if 'old Turk' is not loose,
whether 'Bright' favours the near fore-foot,
(which felt a little hot the day before,)
as he stands up on the hard floor,
and then to inspect 'Swan's' provender-trough,
to see if he has eaten his meal,
for it was carefully noted that at the
'watering-place' last night he drank but
little; whilst at the further end of the
'tie-up' he thinks he hears a little clattering
noise, and presently 'little Star'
is having his shins gently rapped, as a
token of his master's wish to raise his
foot to see if some nail has not given way
in the loosened shoe; and this not for
once, but every day, with numberless
other cares connected with his charge."</p></blockquote>

<p>The oxen are taken out to the forest
by the last detachment of wood-cutters,
when winter fairly sets in. This
is the hardest trip of any. Both man
and beast experience much inconvenience
from the cold. Often, when
driving a boat up rapids, ice forms
upon the poles in the men's hands,
which are already so cold and stiff
that they can scarcely retain their
grasp; yet an instant's cessation of
exertion would be fraught with imminent
peril to life and goods. The
oxen, attached to long lightly-loaded
sleds, are driven over rough miry
tracks. "In crossing large streams,
we unyoke the oxen and swim them
over. If we have no boat, a raft is
constructed, upon which our effects
are transported, when we reyoke and
pursue our route as before. Our
cattle are often very reluctant to
enter the water whilst the anchor-ice
runs, and the cold has already begun
to congeal its surface." Lakes are
crossed upon the ice, which not unfrequently
breaks in. Mr Springer
gives an account of a journey he
made, when this misfortune happened,
and ten oxen at one time
were struggling in the chilling waters
of Baskahegan Lake. They were all
got out, he tells us, although rescue
under such circumstances would appear
almost hopeless.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Standing upon the edge of the ice, a
man was placed by the side of each ox to
keep his head out of the water. We unyoked
one at a time, and throwing a rope
round the roots of his horns, the warp
was carried forward and attached to the
little oxen, (a pair that had not broken
in,) whose services on this occasion were
very necessary. A strong man was
placed on the ice at the edge, so that,
lifting the ox by his horns, he was able
to press the ice down and raise his
shoulder up on the edge, when the warp-oxen
would pull them out. For half-an-hour
we had a lively time of it, and in an
almost incredibly short time we had them
all safely out, and drove them back upon
the point nearly a mile. It was now
very dark. We left our sleds in the
water with the hay, pulling out a few
armsful, which we carried to the shore
to rub the oxen down with. Poor fellows!
they seemed nearly chilled to
death, and shook as if they would fall to
pieces."</p></blockquote>

<p>So great is the labour of taking oxen
to the forest every Fall&mdash;often to a distance
of two hundred miles into the
interior&mdash;that the wood-cutters sometimes
leave them, when they go down
stream in the spring to get their own
living in the wilderness, and hunt
them up again in autumn. They
thrive finely in the interval, and get
very wild and difficult to catch; but
when at last subjugated, they evidently
recognise their masters, and
are pleased to see them. Occasionally
they disappear in the course of the
summer, and are heard of no more;
they are then supposed to have got
"mired or cast," or to have been
devoured by wolves&mdash;or by bears,
which also are known to attack oxen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An individual who owned a very fine
'six-ox team' turned them into the
woods to brouse, in a new region of
country. Late in the evening, his attention
was arrested by the bellowing of one
of them. It continued for an hour or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
two, then ceased altogether. The night
was very dark, and as the ox was supposed
to be more than a mile distant, it
was thought not advisable to venture in
search of him until morning. As soon as
daylight appeared, the owner started, in
company with another man, to investigate
the cause of the uproar. Passing
on about a mile, he found one of his best
oxen prostrate, and, on examination,
there was found a hole eaten into the
thickest part of his hind quarter nearly
as large as a hat; not less than six or
eight pounds of flesh were gone. He
had bled profusely. The ground was
torn up for rods around where the encounter
occurred; the tracks indicated
the assailant to be a very large bear,
who had probably worried the ox out,
and then satiated his ravenous appetite,
feasting upon him while yet alive. A
road was bushed out to the spot where
the poor creature lay, and he was got
upon a sled and hauled home by a yoke
of his companions, where the wound was
dressed. It never, however, entirely
healed, though it was so far improved as
to allow of its being fattened, after which
he was slaughtered for food."</p></blockquote>

<p>In cold weather in those forests
the bears and wolves are exceedingly
audacious. The latter have a curious
habit of accompanying the teams on
their journeys between the forest and
the river to which they drag the logs.
This has only occurred of late years,
and the manner in which they thus
volunteer their services as assistant
drivers is exceedingly curious.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three teams," says Springer, "in the
winter of 1844, all in the same neighbourhood,
were beset with these ravenous
animals. They were of unusually large
size, manifesting a most singular boldness,
and even familiarity, without the
usual appearance of ferocity so characteristic
of the animal. Sometimes one,
and in another instance three, in a most
unwelcome manner, volunteered their
attendance, accompanying the teamster
a long distance on his way. They would
even jump on the log and ride, and approach
very near the oxen. One of them
actually jumped upon the sled, and down
between the bars, while the sled was in
motion. Some of the teamsters were
much alarmed, keeping close to the oxen,
and driving on as fast as possible.
Others, more courageous, would run forward
and strike at them with their goad-sticks;
but the wolves sprang out of the
way in an instant. But, although they
seemed to act without a motive, there
was something so cool and impudent in
their conduct that it was trying to the
nerves&mdash;even more so than an active encounter.
For some time after this, firearms
were a constant part of the teamster's
equipage."</p></blockquote>

<p>The distant howling and screaming
of the wolves, compared by an old
Yankee hunter to the screeching of
forty pair of old cart-wheels, is particularly
ominous and disagreeable.
Springer has collected a number of
curious anecdotes concerning them.
One night a pack of the prowling
marauders were seen trailing down
Mattawamkeag River on the ice.
The dwellers in a log-house hard
by soaked some meat in poison and
threw it out. Next morning the
meat was gone, and six wolves lay
dead, all within sight of each other.
"Every one of them had dug a hole
down through the snow into the
frozen earth, in which they had
thrust their noses, either for water
to quench the burning thirst produced
by the poison, or to snuff some
antidote to the fatal drug. A bounty
was obtained on each of ten dollars,
besides their hides, making a fair job
of it, as well as ridding the neighbourhood
of an annoying enemy."
Several of Mr Springer's logging and
lumbering friends have contributed
to his book the results of their experience,
and narratives of their adventures,
some of which he gives in
their own words. Amongst these is
an ill-written, but yet a very exciting,
account of a wolf-chase, or we should
perhaps rather say a man-chase, the
wolves in this instance being the pursuers,
and Springer's neighbour the
pursued. The person in question was
passionately fond of skating, and one
night he left a friend's house to skate
a short distance up the frozen Kennebeck,
which flowed before the door.
It was a bright still evening; the new
moon silvered the frosty pines. After
gliding a couple of miles up the river,
the skater turned off into a little
tributary stream, over which fir
and hemlock twined their evergreen
branches. The archway beneath was
dark, but he fearlessly entered it,
unsuspicious of peril, with a joyous
laugh and hurra&mdash;an involuntary expression
of exhilaration, elicited by
the bracing crispness of the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
and glow of pleasant exercise.
What followed is worth extracting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All of a sudden a sound arose, it
seemed from the very ice beneath my
feet. It was loud and tremendous at
first, until it ended in one long yell. I
was appalled. Never before had such
a noise met my ears. I thought it more
than mortal&mdash;so fierce, and amid such
an unbroken solitude, that it seemed a
fiend from hell had blown a blast from
an infernal trumpet. Presently I heard
the twigs on the shore snap as if from
the tread of some animal, and the blood
rushed back to my forehead with a bound
that made my skin burn. My energies
returned, and I looked around me for
some means of defence. The moon shone
through the opening by which I had
entered the forest, and, considering this
the best means of escape, I darted towards
it like an arrow. It was hardly
a hundred yards distant, and the swallow
could scarcely outstrip my desperate
flight; yet as I turned my eyes to the
shore, I could see two dark objects
dashing through the underbrush at a
pace nearly double mine. By their great
speed, and the short yells which they
occasionally gave, I knew at once that
they were the much dreaded grey wolf."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here Springer interposes a vignette
of a wolf&mdash;a most formidable and unwholesome-looking
quadruped&mdash;grinning
over the well-picked bone of
some unlucky victim. The logger's
pages are enlivened by a number of
illustrations&mdash;woodcuts of course&mdash;rough
enough in execution, but giving
an excellent notion of the scenery,
animals, and logging operations
spoken of in the text. Grey wolves
are of untameable fierceness, great
strength and speed, and pursue their
prey to the death with frightful tenacity,
unwearyingly following the
trail&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With their long gallop, which can tire<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hounds' deep hate, the hunter's fire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A more dangerous foe a benighted
traveller could hardly fall in with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The bushes that skirted the shore,"
continues the hunted of wolves, "flew
past with the velocity of light as I
dashed on in my flight. The outlet was
nearly gained; one second more and I
should be comparatively safe; when my
pursuers appeared on the bank, directly
above me, which rose to the height of
some ten feet. There was no time for
thought; I bent my head, and dashed
wildly forward. The wolves sprang,
but, miscalculating my speed, sprang
behind, whilst their intended prey glided
out into the river.</p>

<p>"Nature turned me towards home.
The light flakes of snow spun from the
iron of my skates, and I was now some
distance from my pursuers, when their
fierce howl told me that I was again the
fugitive. I did not look back; I did not
feel sorry or glad; one thought of home,
of the bright faces awaiting my return,
of their tears if they should never see me
again, and then every energy of body and
mind was exerted for my escape. I was
perfectly at home on the ice. Many were
the days I spent on my skates, never
thinking that at one time they would be
my only means of safety. Every half
minute an alternate yelp from my pursuers
made me but too certain they were
close at my heels. Nearer and nearer
they came; I heard their feet pattering
on the ice nearer still, until I fancied I
could hear their deep breathing. Every
nerve and muscle in my frame was
stretched to the utmost tension. The
trees along the shore seemed to dance in
the uncertain light, and my brain turned
with my own breathless speed, when an
involuntary motion turned me out of my
course. The wolves close behind, unable
to stop and as unable to turn, slipped,
fell, still going on far ahead, their tongues
lolling out, their white tusks gleaming
from their bloody mouths, their dark
shaggy breasts freckled with foam; and
as they passed me their eyes glared, and
they howled with rage and fury. The
thought flashed on my mind that by this
means I could avoid them&mdash;viz., by turning
aside whenever they came too near; for
they, by the formation of their feet, are
unable to run on ice except in a right
line.</p>

<p>"I immediately acted on this plan.
The wolves, having regained their feet,
sprang directly towards me. The race
was renewed for twenty yards up the
stream; they were already close on my
back, when I glided round and dashed
past them. A fierce howl greeted my
evolution, and the wolves slipped upon
their haunches, and sailed onward, presenting
a perfect picture of helplessness
and baffled rage. Thus I gained nearly
a hundred yards each turning. This was
repeated two or three times, every moment
the wolves getting more excited
and baffled, until, coming opposite the
house, a couple of staghounds, aroused by
the noise, bayed furiously from their
kennels. The wolves, taking the hint,
stopped in their mad career, and, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
moment's consideration, turned and fled.
I watched them till their dusky forms
disappeared over a neighbouring hill;
then, taking off my skates, I wended my
way to the house."</p></blockquote>

<p>From some unassigned reason,
wolves have increased of late years in
the wild forests of north-eastern
Maine. Up to 1840, Mr Springer, who
had been much in that district, logging
in winter and clearing land in summer,
never saw one. Since then they
have frequently been seen in numerous
parties, and of most formidable size.
There would not seem to be much to
choose, as far as the pleasure of the
thing goes, between an encounter
with one of these ravenous brutes and
a tussle with a catamount. Springer,
however, who must be competent to
judge, considers the catamount the
worse customer. He tells an ugly
story, which may serve as a pendant
to that of the bear's breakfast on live
beef, of what happened to a logger
named Smith, when on his way to
join a timbering party in the woods.
He had nearly reached camp, when
he fell in with a catamount, or
"Indian devil." Retreat was impossible;
for reflection there was no
time: arms he had none. Acting
from impulse, he sprang up a small
tree&mdash;perhaps as sensible a thing as
he could have done. He had scarcely
ascended his length, when the creature,
fierce from hunger, made a bound
and caught him by the heel. Although
badly bitten, Smith managed
to get his foot out of the shoe, in
which the tiger-cat's teeth were firmly
set, and shoe and savage fell together
to the ground. What then ensued is
so horrible and extraordinary that we
should suspect our wood-cutting friend
of imaginative decoration, but for the
assurance he gives us in his preface,
that "the incidents he has related
are real, and that in no case is the
truth sacrificed to fancy or embellishment."
He shall finish his yarn
himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The moment he was disengaged,
Smith sprang for a more secure position,
and the animal at the same time leaped
to another large tree, about ten feet distant,
up which he ascended to an elevation
equal to that of his victim, from
which he threw himself upon him, firmly
fixing his teeth in the calf of his leg.
Hanging suspended thus until the flesh,
insufficient to sustain the weight, gave
way, he dropped again to the ground,
carrying a portion of flesh in his mouth.
<em>Having greedily devoured this morsel</em>, he
bounded again up the opposite tree, and
from thence upon Smith, in this manner
renewing his attacks, and tearing away
the flesh in mouthfuls from his legs.
During this agonising operation, Smith
contrived to cut a limb from the tree, to
which he managed to bind his jack-knife,
with which he could now assail his enemy
at every leap. He succeeded thus in
wounding him so badly that at length his
attacks were discontinued, and he disappeared
in the dense forest."</p></blockquote>

<p>Smith, who, as Springer coolly
informs us, "had exerted his
voice to the utmost," whilst the
catamount was devouring him in
detail, (we can perfectly imagine a
man bellowing like twenty bulls under
such circumstances,) was found by
his friends in a state of dreadful
exhaustion and suffering, and was
carried to camp on a litter. He ultimately
recovered, but had sustained
irreparable injuries. "Such desperate
encounters are of rare occurrence,"
Springer quietly adds. We
should think they were. Really these
loggers are cool hands. Encounters
with black bears are much more common,
we are informed. These are
strong fellows, clever at parrying
blows, and at wrenching the weapon
from their assailant's hand&mdash;very
tenacious of life, and confirmed robbers.
Springer and his comrades
were once, whilst ascending a river,
followed by one of them for several
days. He was bent upon plunder,
and one night he walked off with a
bundle containing clothing, boots,
shaving implements, and other things,
for which it might be thought a bear
could have little occasion. He examined
his prize in the neighbourhood
of the camp, tore the clothes to
shreds, and chewed up the cow-hide
boots and the handle of a razor.
From the roof of a log-house, which
the woodmen erected a few miles farther
on, he carried off a ten-gallon keg
of molasses, set it on one end, knocked
the head in or out, and was about to
enjoy the feast, when he was discovered,
pursued, and at last killed.
At page 140 we find a capital account
of a fight between a family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
bears (father, mother, and cubs) and
two foresters; and at page 100 the
stirring-up of a bear's den is graphically
described.</p>

<p>The pine tree is subject to disease of
more than one kind, the most frequent
being a sort of cancer, known amongst
lumber-men as "Conk" or "Konkus,"
whose sole external manifestation is a
small brown spot, usually at several
feet from the ground, and sometimes no
larger than a shilling. The trees thus
afflicted are noway inferior to the
soundest in size and apparent beauty;
but on cutting into them the rot is at
once evident, the wood being reddish
in colour, and of spungy texture.
"Sometimes it shoots upwards, in
imitation of the streaming light of the
aurora borealis; in others downwards,
and even both ways, preserving the
same appearance." Unscrupulous loggers
cheat the unwary by driving a
knot or piece of a limb of the same
tree into the plague-spot, and hewing
it off smoothly, so as to give it the
appearance of a natural knot. A
great many pines are hollow at the
base or butt, and these hollows are
the favourite winter-retreats of Bruin
the bear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A few rods from the main logging
road where I worked one winter," said
Mr Johnston, (a logger whom Springer
more than once quotes,) "there stood a
very large pine tree. We had nearly
completed our winter's work, and it still
stood unmolested, because, from appearances,
it was supposed to be worthless.
Whilst passing it one day, not quite satisfied
with the decision that had been
made upon its quality, I resolved to satisfy
my own mind touching its value; so,
wallowing to it through the snow, which
was nearly up to my middle, I struck it
several blows with the head of my axe,
an experiment to test whether a tree be
hollow or not. When I desisted, my
attention was arrested by a slight scratching
and whining. Suspecting the cause,
I thumped the tree again, listening more
attentively, and heard the same noise as
before. It was a bear's den. Examining
the tree more closely, I discovered a
small hole in the trunk, near the roots,
with a rim of ice on the edge of the orifice,
made by the freezing of the breath
and vapour from the inmates."</p></blockquote>

<p>The logging crew were summoned,
and came scampering down, eager for
the fun. The snow was kicked away
from the root of the tree, exposing
the entrance to the den; and a small
hole was cut in the opposite side,
through which the family of bears
were literally "stirred up with a long
pole;" and when the great she-bear,
annoyed at this treatment, put her
head out at the door, she was cut
over the pate with an axe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The cubs, four in number&mdash;a thing
unusual by one-half&mdash;we took alive, and
carried to camp, kept them a while, and
finally sold them. They were quite
small and harmless, of a most beautiful
lustrous black, and fat as porpoises. The
old dam was uncommonly large&mdash;we
judged she might weigh about three hundred
pounds. Her hide, when stretched
out and nailed on to the end of the camp,
appeared quite equal to a cow's hide in
dimensions."</p></blockquote>

<p>The attacks of wild animals are
far from being the sole dangers to
which the wood-cutters of Maine
are exposed in following their toilsome
occupation. Scarcely any phase
of their adventurous existence is
exempt from risk. Bad wounds are
sometimes accidentally received from
the axe whilst felling trees. To heal
these, in the absence of surgeons,
the loggers are thrown upon their
own very insufficient resources. Life
is also constantly endangered in felling
the pine, which comes plunging
down, breaking, splitting, and crushing
all before it. The broken limbs
which are torn from the fallen tree,
and the branches it wrenches from
other trees,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"rendered brittle by the intense frosts,
fly in every direction, like the scattered
fragments of an exploding ship. Often
these wrenched limbs are suspended
directly over the place where our work
requires our presence, and on the
slightest motion, or from a sudden gust of
wind, they slip down with the stealthiness
of a hawk and the velocity of an arrow.
I recollect one in particular, which was
wrenched from a large pine I had just
felled. It lodged in the top of a towering
birch, directly over where it was necessary
for me to stand whilst severing the
top from the trunk. Viewing its position
with some anxiety, I ventured to stand
and work under it, forgetting my danger
in the excitement. Whilst thus engaged,
the limb slipped from its position, and,
falling directly before me, end foremost,
penetrated the frozen earth. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
about four inches through, and ten
feet long. It just grazed my cap; a
little variation, and it would have dashed
my head to pieces. Attracted on one
occasion, whilst swamping a road, by
the appearance of a large limb which
stuck fast in the ground, curiosity induced
me to extricate it, for the purpose
of seeing how far it had penetrated.
After considerable exertion, I succeeded
in drawing it out, when I was amazed
<em>to find a thick cloth cap on the end of it</em>.
It had penetrated the earth to a considerable
depth. Subsequently I learned
that <em>it</em> [the cap, we presume, but Springer
makes sad work of his pronouns] belonged
to a man who was killed instantly by
<em>its</em> fall, [here our logging friend must be
supposed to refer to the timber,] striking
him on the head, and carrying his
cap into the ground with it."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not impossible, although
it does a little remind us of certain
adventures of the renowned Munchausen.
And Springer is so pleasant
a fellow, that we shall not call his
veracity in question, or even tax
him with that tinting of truth in
which many of his countrymen excel,
but of which he only here and there
lays himself open to suspicion. He
certainly does put our credulity
a little to the strain by an anecdote
of a moose deer, which he gives,
however, between inverted commas,
on the authority of a hunter who
occasionally passed the night at the
logger's camp. The moose is the
largest species of deer found in the
New-England forests, its size varying
from that of a large pony to that of
a full-grown horse. It has immense
branching antlers, and, judging from
its portrait, which forms the frontispiece
to <cite>Forest Life</cite>, we readily
believe Springer's assurance, that
"the taking of moose is sometimes
quite hazardous." Quite astonishing,
we are sure the reader will say,
is the following ride:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once," hunter <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loquitur</i>, "whilst out
on a hunting excursion, I was pursued
by a bull-moose. He approached me
with his muscular neck curved, and
head to the ground, in a manner not
dissimilar to the attitude assumed by
horned cattle when about to encounter
each other. Just as he was about to
make a pass at me, I sprang suddenly
between his wide-spreading antlers, bestride
his neck. Dexterously turning
round, I seized him by the horns, and,
locking my feet together under his neck,
I clung to him like a sloth. With a
mixture of rage and terror, he dashed
wildly about, endeavouring to dislodge
me; but, as my life depended upon
maintaining my position, I clung to him
with a corresponding desperation. After
making a few ineffectual attempts to
disengage me, he threw out his nose,
and, laying his antlers back upon his
shoulders, <em>which formed a screen for my
defence</em>, he sprang forward into a furious
run, still bearing me upon his neck.
Now penetrating dense thickets, then
leaping high 'windfalls,' (old fallen
trees,) and struggling through swamp-mires,
he finally fell from exhaustion,
after carrying me about three miles.
Improving the opportunity, I drew my
hunting-knife from its sheath, and instantly
buried it in his neck, cutting the
jugular vein, which put a speedy termination
to the contest and the flight."</p></blockquote>

<p>After which we presume that he
spitted the moose on a pine tree,
roasted and ate it, and used its antlers
for toothpicks. The adventure is
worthy of Mazeppa or the Wild
Huntsman. By the antlers <em>forming
a screen for the rider's defence</em>, we are
reminded of that memorable morning
in the life of the great German Baron,
when his horse, cut in two, just behind
the saddle, by the fall of a portcullis,
was sewn together with laurel-twigs,
which sprouted up into a pleasant
bower, beneath whose appropriate
shade the redoubtable warrior
thenceforward rode to victory. An
awful liar, indeed, must have been
the narrator of this "singular adventure,"
as Springer, who tells this story
quite gravely, artlessly styles it.
Doubtless such yarns are acceptable
enough by the camp-fire, where the
weary logger smokes the pipe of repose
after a hard day's work; and
they are by no means out of place in
the logger's book, of which, however,
they occupy but a small portion&mdash;by
far the greater number of its chapters
being filled with solid and curious
information. The third and longest
part, "River Life," upon which we
have not touched, is highly interesting,
and gives thrilling accounts of
the dangers incurred during the progress
down stream of the various
"parcels" of logs, which, each distinguished
like cattle by the owner's
mark, soon mingle and form one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
grand "drive" on the main river.
"Driving" of this kind is a very
hazardous occupation. Sometimes
the logs come to a "jam," get wedged
together in a narrow part of the river
or amongst rocks, and, whilst the
drivers work with axe and lever to
set the huge floating field of tree-trunks
in motion again, lives are frequently
lost. This is easy to understand.
The removal of a single log,
the keystone of the mass&mdash;nay, a
single blow of the axe&mdash;often suffices
to liberate acres of timber from their
"dead lock," and set them furiously
rushing down the rapid current.
Then does woe betide those who are
caught in the hurly-burly. Sometimes,
the key-log being well ascertained,
a man is let down, like a samphire-gatherer,
by a rope from an
adjacent cliff, on to the "jam."
Then&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the place to be operated upon may
in some cases be a little removed from
the shore, he either walks to it with the
rope attached to his body, or, untying the
rope, leaves it where he can readily grasp
it in time to be drawn from his perilous
position. Often, where the pressure is
direct, a few blows only are given with
the axe, when the log snaps in an instant
with a loud report, followed suddenly
by the violent motion of the 'jam;' and,
ere our bold river-driver is jerked half
way to the top of the cliff, scores of logs,
in wildest confusion, rush beneath his
feet, whilst he yet dangles in the air
above the trembling mass. If that rope,
on which life and hope hang thus suspended,
should part, worn by the sharp
point of some jutting rock, death, certain
and quick, were inevitable."</p></blockquote>

<p>The wood-cutter's occupation, which,
to European imagination, presents
itself as peaceful, pastoral, and void
of peril, assumes a very different aspect
when pursued in North American
forests. If any doubt this fact, let
them study Springer, who will repay
the trouble, and of whose volume we
have rather skimmed the surface than
meddled with the substance.</p>

<h2>MY NOVEL; OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.</h2>

<h3>BY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<p>Randal advanced&mdash;"I fear, Signior
Riccabocca, that I am guilty of
some want of ceremony."</p>

<p>"To dispense with ceremony is
the most delicate mode of conferring
a compliment," replied the urbane
Italian, as he recovered from his first
surprise at Randal's sudden address,
and extended his hand.</p>

<p>Violante bowed her graceful head
to the young man's respectful salutation.
"I am on my way to Hazeldean,"
resumed Randal, "and, seeing
you in the garden, could not resist
this intrusion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"You come from
London? Stirring times for you English,
but I do not ask you the news.
No news can affect us."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>, (softly.)&mdash;"Perhaps&mdash;yes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca</span>, (startled.)&mdash;"How?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"Surely he speaks of
Italy, and news from that country
affects you still, my father."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"Nay, nay, nothing
affects me like this country; its east
winds might affect a pyramid!
Draw your mantle round you, child,
and go in; the air has suddenly
grown chill."</p>

<p>Violante smiled on her father,
glanced uneasily towards Randal's
grave brow, and went slowly towards
the house.</p>

<p>Riccabocca, after waiting some
moments in silence, as if expecting
Randal to speak, said with affected
carelessness, "So you think that you
have news that might affect me?
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corpo di Bacco!</i> I am curious to
learn what!"</p>

<p>"I may be mistaken&mdash;that depends
on your answer to one question. Do
you know the Count of Peschiera?"</p>

<p>Riccabocca winced, and turned
pale. He could not baffle the watchful
eye of the questioner.</p>

<p>"Enough," said Randal; "I see
that I am right. Believe in my sincerity.
I speak but to warn and to
serve you. The Count seeks to discover
the retreat of a countryman
and kinsman of his own."</p>

<p>"And for what end?" cried Riccabocca,
thrown off his guard, and his
breast dilated, his crest rose, and
his eye flashed; valour and defiance
broke from habitual caution and self-control.
"But pooh," he added,
striving to regain his ordinary and
half-ironical calm, "it matters not to
me. I grant, sir, that I know the
Count di Peschiera; but what has
Dr Riccabocca to do with the kinsmen
of so grand a personage?"</p>

<p>"Dr Riccabocca&mdash;nothing. But&mdash;"
here Randal put his lip close to the
Italian's ear, and whispered a brief
sentence. Then retreating a step,
but laying his hand on the exile's
shoulder, he added&mdash;"Need I say
that your secret is safe with me?"</p>

<p>Riccabocca made no answer. His
eyes rested on the ground musingly.</p>

<p>Randal continued&mdash;"And I shall
esteem it the highest honour you
can bestow on me, to be permitted
to assist you in forestalling
danger."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca</span>, (slowly.)&mdash;"Sir, I
thank you; you have my secret, and I
feel assured it is safe, for I speak to
an English gentleman. There may
be family reasons why I should avoid
the Count di Peschiera; and, indeed,
He is safest from shoals who steers
clearest of his&mdash;relations."</p>

<p>The poor Italian regained his
caustic smile as he uttered that wise,
villanous Italian maxim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"I know little of the
Count of Peschiera save from the
current talk of the world. He is said
to hold the estates of a kinsman who
took part in a conspiracy against the
Austrian power."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"It is true. Let
that content him; what more does he
desire. You spoke of forestalling
danger; what danger? I am on the
soil of England, and protected by its
laws."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Allow me to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
if, had the kinsman no child, the
Count di Peschiera would be legitimate
and natural heir to the estates
he holds?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"He would. What
then?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Does that thought
suggest no danger to the child of the
kinsman?"</p>

<p>Riccabocca recoiled, and gasped
forth, "The child! You do not mean
to imply that this man, infamous
though he be, can contemplate the
crime of an assassin?"</p>

<p>Randal paused perplexed. His
ground was delicate. He knew not
what causes of resentment the exile
entertained against the Count. He
knew not whether Riccabocca would
not assent to an alliance that might
restore him to his country&mdash;and he
resolved to feel his way with precaution.</p>

<p>"I did not," said he, smiling
gravely, "mean to insinuate so horrible
a charge against a man whom I
have never seen. He seeks you&mdash;that
is all I know. I imagine, from his
general character, that in this search
he consults his interest. Perhaps all
matters might be conciliated by an
interview!"</p>

<p>"An interview!" exclaimed Riccabocca;
"there is but one way we
should meet&mdash;foot to foot, and hand
to hand."</p>

<p>"Is it so? Then you would not
listen to the Count if he proposed
some amicable compromise; if, for instance,
he was a candidate for the
hand of your daughter?"</p>

<p>The poor Italian, so wise and so
subtle in his talk, was as rash and
blind when it came to action, as if he
had been born in Ireland, and nourished
on potatoes and Repeal. He bared
his whole soul to the merciless eye of
Randal.</p>

<p>"My daughter!" he exclaimed.
"Sir, your very question is an insult."</p>

<p>Randal's way became clear at once.
"Forgive me," he said mildly; "I
will tell you frankly all that I know.
I am acquainted with the Count's
sister. I have some little influence
over her. It was she who informed
me that the Count had come here,
bent upon discovering your refuge,
and resolved to wed your daughter.
This is the danger of which I spoke.
And when I asked your permission to
aid in forestalling it, I only intended
to suggest that it might be wise to
find some securer home, and that I,
if permitted to know that home, and
to visit you, could apprise you from
time to time of the Count's plans and
movements."</p>

<p>"Sir, I thank you sincerely," said
Riccabocca with emotion; "but am I
not safe here?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Many people have
visited the Squire in the shooting
season, who will have heard of you&mdash;perhaps
seen you, and who are likely
to meet the Count in London. And
Frank Hazeldean, too, who knows
the Count's sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True, true," interrupted Riccabocca.
"I see, I see. I will consider.
I will reflect. Meanwhile you are
going to Hazeldean. Do not say a
word to the Squire. He knows not
the secret you have discovered."</p>

<p>With those words Riccabocca turned
slightly away, and Randal took
the hint to depart.</p>

<p>"At all times command and rely
on me," said the young traitor, and
he regained the pale to which he had
fastened his horse.</p>

<p>As he remounted, he cast his
eyes towards the place where he had
left Riccabocca. The Italian was
still standing there. Presently the
form of Jackeymo was seen emerging
from the shrubs. Riccabocca
turned hastily round, recognised his
servant, uttered an exclamation loud
enough to reach Randal's ear, and
then catching Jackeymo by the arm,
disappeared with him amidst the
deeper recesses of the garden.</p>

<p>"It will be indeed in my favour,"
thought Randal as he rode on, "if I
can get them into the neighbourhood
of London&mdash;all occasion there to woo,
and if expedient, to win&mdash;the heiress."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<p>"By the Lord Harry!" cried the
Squire, as he stood with his wife in
the park, on a visit of inspection to
some first-rate South-Downs just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
added to his stock&mdash;"By the Lord,
if that is not Randal Leslie trying
to get into the park at the back
gate! Hollo, Randal! you must come
round by the lodge, my boy," said he.</p>

<p>"You see this gate is locked to keep
out trespassers."</p>

<p>"A pity," said Randal. "I like
short cuts, and you have shut up a
very short one."</p>

<p>"So the trespassers said," quoth
the Squire; "but Stirn would not
hear of it;&mdash;valuable man, Stirn. But
ride round to the lodge. Put up your
horse, and you'll join us before we can
get to the house."</p>

<p>Randal nodded and smiled, and
rode briskly on.</p>

<p>The Squire rejoined his Harry.</p>

<p>"Ah, William," said she anxiously,
"though certainly Randal Leslie
means well, I always dread his visits."</p>

<p>"So do I, in one sense," quoth the
Squire, "for he always carries away
a bank-note for Frank."</p>

<p>"I hope he is really Frank's friend,"
said Mrs Hazeldean.</p>

<p>"Whose else can he be? Not his
own, poor fellow, for he will never
accept a shilling from me, though his
grandmother was as good a Hazeldean
as I am. But, zounds! I like his
pride, and his economy too. As for
Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, William!" cried Mrs Hazeldean,
and put her fair hand before the
Squire's mouth. The Squire was
softened, and kissed the fair hand
gallantly&mdash;perhaps he kissed the lips
too; at all events, the worthy pair
were walking lovingly arm-in-arm
when Randal joined them.</p>

<p>He did not affect to perceive a certain
coldness in the manner of Mrs
Hazeldean, but began immediately to
talk to her about Frank; praise that
young gentleman's appearance; expatiate
on his health, his popularity, and
his good gifts, personal and mental;
and this with so much warmth, that
any dim and undeveloped suspicions
Mrs Hazeldean might have formed
soon melted away.</p>

<p>Randal continued to make himself
thus agreeable, until the Squire, persuaded
that his young kinsman was a
first-rate agriculturist, insisted upon
carrying him off to the home farm,
and Harry turned towards the house to
order Randal's room to be got ready:
"For," said Randal, "knowing that
you will excuse my morning dress, I
venture to invite myself to dine and
sleep at the Hall."</p>

<p>On approaching the farm-buildings,
Randal was seized with the terror
of an impostor; for, despite all the
theoretical learning on Bucolics and
Georgics with which he had dazzled
the Squire, poor Frank, so despised,
would have beat him hollow when it
came to judging of the points of an ox
or the show of a crop.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" cried the Squire, chuckling,
"I long to see how you'll astonish
Stirn. Why, you'll guess in a
moment where we put the top-dressing;
and when you come to handle
my short-horns, I dare swear you'll
know to a pound how much oilcake
has gone into their sides."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do me too much honour&mdash;indeed
you do. I only know the
general principles of agriculture&mdash;the
details are eminently interesting; but
I have not had the opportunity to acquire
them."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" cried the Squire. "How
can a man know general principles
unless he has first studied the details?
You are too modest, my boy. Ho!
there's Stirn looking out for us!"</p>

<p>Randal saw the grim visage of Stirn
peering out of a cattle-shed, and felt
undone. He made a desperate rush
towards changing the Squire's humour.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, perhaps Frank may soon
gratify your wish and turn farmer
himself."</p>

<p>"Eh!" quoth the Squire, stopping
short. "What now?"</p>

<p>"Suppose he was to marry?"</p>

<p>"I'd give him the two best farms
on the property rent free. Ha, ha!
Has he seen the girl yet? I'd leave
him free to choose, sir. I chose for
myself&mdash;every man should. Not but
what Miss Sticktorights is an heiress,
and, I hear, a very decent girl, and
that would join the two properties,
and put an end to that lawsuit about
the right of way, which began in the
reign of King Charles the Second, and
is likely otherwise to last till the day
of judgment. But never mind her;
let Frank choose to please himself."</p>

<p>"I'll not fail to tell him so, sir. I
did fear you might have some prejudices.
But here we are at the farm-yard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>"Burn the farm-yard! How can
I think of farm-yards when you talk
of Frank's marriage? Come on&mdash;this
way. What were you saying about
prejudices?"</p>

<p>"Why, you might wish him to marry
an Englishwoman, for instance."</p>

<p>"English! Good heavens, sir, does
he mean to marry a Hindoo?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I don't know that he means
to marry at all: I am only surmising;
but if he did fall in love with a
foreigner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A foreigner! Ah, then Harry
was&mdash;" The Squire stopped short.</p>

<p>"Who might, perhaps," observed
Randal&mdash;not truly if he referred to
Madame di Negra&mdash;"who might, perhaps,
speak very little English?"</p>

<p>"Lord ha' mercy!"</p>

<p>"And a Roman Catholic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Worshipping idols, and roasting
people who don't worship them."</p>

<p>"Signior Riccabocca is not so bad
as that."</p>

<p>"Rickeybockey! Well, if it was
his daughter! But not speak English!
and not go to the parish church! By
George! if Frank thought of such a
thing, I'd cut him off with a shilling.
Don't talk to me, sir; I would. I'm
a mild man, and an easy man; but
when I say a thing, I say it, Mr. Leslie.
Oh, but it is a jest&mdash;you are laughing
at me. There's no such painted, good-for-nothing
creature in Frank's eye,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, if ever I find there is,
I will give you notice in time. At
present I was only trying to ascertain
what you wished for a daughter-in-law.
You said you had no prejudice."</p>

<p>"No more I have&mdash;not a bit of it."</p>

<p>"You don't like a foreigner and a
Catholic?"</p>

<p>"Who the devil would?"</p>

<p>"But if she had rank and title?"</p>

<p>"Rank and title! Bubble and
squeak! No, not half so good as
bubble and squeak. English beef and
good cabbage. But foreign rank and
title!&mdash;foreign cabbage and beef!&mdash;foreign
bubble and foreign squeak!"
And the Squire made a wry face, and
spat forth his disgust and indignation.</p>

<p>"You must have an Englishwoman?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"Don't care, provided she is a tidy,
sensible, active lass, with a good
character for her dower."</p>

<p>"Character&mdash;ah, that is indispensable?"</p>

<p>"I should think so, indeed. A Mrs.
Hazeldean of Hazeldean; you frighten
me. He's not going to run off with a
divorced woman, or a&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Squire stopped, and looked so
red in the face, that Randal feared he
might be seized with apoplexy before
Frank's crimes had made him alter his
will.</p>

<p>Therefore he hastened to relieve
Mr Hazeldean's mind, and assured
him that he had been only talking at
random; that Frank was in the habit,
indeed, of seeing foreign ladies occasionally,
as all persons in the London
world were; but that he was sure Frank
would never marry without the full
consent and approval of his parents.
He ended by repeating his assurance,
that he would warn the Squire if ever
it became necessary. Still, however,
he left Mr Hazeldean so disturbed and
uneasy, that that gentleman forgot all
about the farm, and went moodily on
in the opposite direction, re-entering
the park at its farther extremity.
As soon as they approached the house,
the Squire hastened to shut himself
with his wife in full parental consultation;
and Randal, seated upon a
bench on the terrace, revolved the
mischief he had done, and its chances
of success.</p>

<p>While thus seated, and thus thinking,
a footstep approached cautiously,
and a low voice said, in broken English,
"Sare, sare, let me speak vid
you."</p>

<p>Randal turned in surprise, and beheld
a swarthy saturnine face, with
grizzled hair and marked features. He
recognised the figure that had joined
Riccabocca in the Italian's garden.</p>

<p>"Speak-a you Italian?" resumed
Jackeymo.</p>

<p>Randal, who had made himself an
excellent linguist, nodded assent;
and Jackeymo, rejoiced, begged him
to withdraw into a more private
part of the grounds.</p>

<p>Randal obeyed, and the two gained
the shade of a stately chestnut avenue.</p>

<p>"Sir," then said Jackeymo, speaking
in his native tongue, and expressing
himself with a certain simple
pathos, "I am but a poor man; my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
name is Giacomo. You have heard
of me;&mdash;servant to the Signior
whom you saw to-day&mdash;only a servant;
but he honours me with his
confidence. We have known danger
together; and of all his friends and
followers, I alone came with him to
the stranger's land."</p>

<p>"Good, faithful fellow," said
Randal, examining the man's face,
"say on. Your master confides in
you? He confided that which I told
him this day?"</p>

<p>"He did. Ah, sir! the Padrone
was too proud to ask you to explain
more&mdash;too proud to show fear of
another. But he does fear&mdash;he ought
to fear&mdash;he shall fear," (continued
Jackeymo, working himself up to
passion)&mdash;"for the Padrone has a
daughter, and his enemy is a villain.
Oh, sir, tell me all that you did not
tell to the Padrone. You hinted
that this man might wish to marry
the Signora. Marry her!&mdash;I could
cut his throat at the altar!"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Randal; "I believe
that such is his object."</p>

<p>"But why? He is rich&mdash;she is
penniless; no, not quite that, for we
have saved&mdash;but penniless, compared
to him."</p>

<p>"My good friend, I know not yet
his motives; but I can easily learn
them. If, however, this Count be
your master's enemy, it is surely
well to guard against him, whatever
his designs; and, to do so, you
should move into London or its
neighbourhood. I fear that, while
we speak, the Count may get upon
his track."</p>

<p>"He had better not come here!"
cried the servant menacingly, and
putting his hand where the knife was
<em>not</em>.</p>

<p>"Beware of your own anger,
Giacomo. One act of violence, and
you would be transported from England,
and your master would lose a
friend."</p>

<p>Jackeymo seemed struck by this
caution.</p>

<p>"And if the Padrone were to meet
him, do you think the Padrone would
meekly say, 'Come stà sa Signoria?'
The Padrone would strike
him dead!"</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;hush! You speak of
what, in England, is called murder,
and is punished by the gallows. If
you really love your master, for
heaven's sake get him from this
place&mdash;get him from all chance of
such passion and peril. I go to
town to-morrow; I will find him a
house that shall be safe from all
spies&mdash;all discovery. And there,
too, my friend, I can do&mdash;what I cannot
at this distance&mdash;watch over
him, and keep watch also on his
enemy."</p>

<p>Jackeymo seized Randal's hand
and lifted it towards his lip; then, as
if struck by a sudden suspicion,
dropped the hand, and said bluntly&mdash;"Signior,
I think you have seen
the Padrone twice. Why do you
take this interest in him?"</p>

<p>"Is it so uncommon to take
interest even in a stranger who is
menaced by some peril?"</p>

<p>Jackeymo, who believed little in
general philanthropy, shook his head
sceptically.</p>

<p>"Besides," continued Randal, suddenly
bethinking himself of a more
plausible reason&mdash;"besides, I am
a friend and connection of Mr Egerton;
and Mr Egerton's most intimate
friend is Lord L'Estrange; and I
have heard that Lord L'Estrange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The good lord! Oh, now I
understand," interrupted Jackeymo,
and his brow cleared. "Ah, if <em>he</em>
were in England! But you will let
us know when he comes?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Now, tell me, Giacomo,
is this Count really unprincipled
and dangerous? Remember,
I know him not personally."</p>

<p>"He has neither heart, head, nor
conscience."</p>

<p>"That makes him dangerous to
men; but to women, danger comes
from other qualities. Could it be
possible, if he obtained any interview
with the Signora, that he could win
her affections?"</p>

<p>Jackeymo crossed himself rapidly,
and made no answer.</p>

<p>"I have heard that he is still very
handsome."</p>

<p>Jackeymo groaned.</p>

<p>Randal resumed&mdash;"Enough; persuade
the Padrone to come to
town."</p>

<p>"But if the Count is in town?"</p>

<p>"That makes no difference; the
safest place is always the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
city. Everywhere else a foreigner
is in himself an object of attention
and curiosity."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"Let your master, then, come to
London. He can reside in one of the
suburbs most remote from the Count's
haunts. In two days I will have
found him a lodging and write to
him. You trust to me now?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed&mdash;I do, Excellency.
Ah, if the Signorina were married,
we would not care!"</p>

<p>"Married! But she looks so high!"</p>

<p>"Alas! not now&mdash;not here!"</p>

<p>Randal sighed heavily. Jackeymo's
eyes sparkled. He thought
he had detected a new motive for
Randal's interest&mdash;a motive to an
Italian the most natural, the most
laudable of all.</p>

<p>"Find the house, Signior&mdash;write
to the Padrone. He shall come. I'll
talk to him. I can manage him.
Holy San Giacomo, bestir thyself
now&mdash;'tis long since I troubled
thee!"</p>

<p>Jackeymo strode off through the
fading trees, smiling and muttering
as he went.</p>

<p>The first dinner-bell rang, and, on
entering the drawing-room, Randal
found Parson Dale and his wife, who
had been invited in haste to meet
the unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>The preliminary greetings over,
Mr Dale took the opportunity afforded
by the Squire's absence to inquire
after the health of Mr Egerton.</p>

<p>"He is always well," said Randal.
"I believe he is made of iron."</p>

<p>"His heart is of gold," said the
Parson.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Randal, inquisitively,
"you told me you had come in
contact with him once, respecting,
I think, some of your old parishioners
at Lansmere?"</p>

<p>The Parson nodded, and there was
a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Do you remember your battle by
the Stocks, Mr Leslie?" said Mr
Dale, with a good-humoured laugh.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. By the way, now
you speak of it, I met my old
opponent in London the first year I
went up to it."</p>

<p>"You did!&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"At a literary scamp's&mdash;a cleverish
man called Burley."</p>

<p>"Burley! I have seen some burlesque
verses in Greek by a Mr
Burley."</p>

<p>"No doubt, the same person. He
has disappeared&mdash;gone to the dogs,
I dare say. Burlesque Greek is not
a knowledge very much in power
at present."</p>

<p>"Well, but Leonard Fairfield?&mdash;you
have seen him since?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor heard of him?"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"Strange to say, not for a long
time. But I have reason to believe
that he must be doing well."</p>

<p>"You surprise me! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, two years ago, he sent
for his mother. She went to him."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"It is enough; for he would not
have sent for her if he could not
maintain her."</p>

<p>Here the Hazeldeans entered,
arm-in-arm, and the fat butler
announced dinner.</p>

<p>The Squire was unusually taciturn&mdash;Mrs
Hazeldean thoughtful&mdash;Mrs
Dale languid, and headachy. The
Parson, who seldom enjoyed the
luxury of converse with a scholar,
save when he quarrelled with Dr
Riccabocca, was animated, by Randal's
repute for ability, into a great
desire for argument.</p>

<p>"A glass of wine, Mr Leslie. You
were saying, before dinner, that burlesque
Greek is not a knowledge very
much in power at present. Pray, sir,
what knowledge is in power?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>, (laconically.)&mdash;"Practical
knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"What of?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Men."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (candidly.)&mdash;"Well, I
suppose that is the most available
sort of knowledge, in a worldly point
of view. How does one learn it? Do
books help?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"According as they are
read, they help or injure."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"How should they be
read in order to help?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Read specially to apply
to purposes that lead to power."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (very much struck with
Randal's pithy and Spartan logic.)&mdash;"Upon
my word, sir, you express
yourself very well. I must own that
I began these questions in the hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
differing from you; for I like an argument."</p>

<p>"That he does," growled the Squire;
"the most contradictory creature!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Argument is the salt
of talk. But now I am afraid I must
agree with you, which I was not at
all prepared for."</p>

<p>Randal bowed, and answered&mdash;"No
two men of our education can
dispute upon the application of knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (pricking up his ears.)&mdash;"Eh!
what to?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Power, of course."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (overjoyed.)&mdash;"Power!&mdash;the
vulgarest application of it, or the
loftiest? But you mean the loftiest?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>, (in his turn interested
and interrogative.)&mdash;"What do you
call the loftiest, and what the vulgarest?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"The vulgarest, self-interest;
the loftiest, beneficence."</p>

<p>Randal suppressed the half disdainful
smile that rose to his lip.</p>

<p>"You speak, sir, as a clergyman
should do. I admire your sentiment,
and adopt it; but I fear that the
knowledge which aims only at beneficence
very rarely in this world gets
any power at all."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire</span>, (seriously.)&mdash;"That's true;
I never get my own way when I want
to do a kindness, and Stirn always
gets his when he insists on something
diabolically brutal and harsh."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Pray, Mr Leslie, what
does intellectual power refined to the
utmost, but entirely stripped of beneficence,
most resemble?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Resemble?&mdash;I can
hardly say. Some very great man&mdash;almost
any very great man&mdash;who has
baffled all his foes, and attained all
his ends."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"I doubt if any man
has ever become very great who has
not meant to be beneficent, though he
might err in the means. Cæsar was
naturally beneficent, and so was Alexander.
But intellectual power refined
to the utmost, and wholly void of
beneficence, resembles only one being,
and that, sir, is the Principle of Evil."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>, (startled.)&mdash;"Do you
mean the Devil?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Yes, sir&mdash;the Devil;
and even he, sir, did not succeed!
Even he, sir, is what your great men
would call a most decided failure."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"My dear&mdash;my dear."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Our religion proves it,
my love; he was an angel, and he
fell."</p>

<p>There was a solemn pause. Randal
was more impressed than he liked to
own to himself. By this time the
dinner was over, and the servants
had retired. Harry glanced at Carry.
Carry smoothed her gown and rose.</p>

<p>The gentlemen remained over their
wine; and the Parson, satisfied with
what he deemed a clencher upon his
favourite subject of discussion, changed
the subject to lighter topics, till happening
to fall upon tithes, the Squire
struck in, and by dint of loudness of
voice, and truculence of brow, fairly
overwhelmed both his guests, and
proved to his own satisfaction that
tithes were an unjust and unchristian-like
usurpation on the part of the
Church generally, and a most especial
and iniquitous infliction upon the
Hazeldean estates in particular.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<p>On entering the drawing-room,
Randal found the two ladies seated
close together, in a position much more
appropriate to the familiarity of their
school-days than to the politeness of
the friendship now existing between
them. Mrs Hazeldean's hand hung
affectionately over Carry's shoulder,
and both those fair English faces were
bent over the same book. It was pretty
to see these sober matrons, so different
from each other in character and aspect,
thus unconsciously restored to
the intimacy of happy maiden youth
by the golden link of some Magician
from the still land of Truth or Fancy&mdash;brought
together in heart, as each eye
rested on the same thought;&mdash;closer
and closer, as sympathy, lost in the
actual world, grew out of that world
which unites in one bond of feeling
the readers of some gentle book.</p>

<p>"And what work interests you so
much?" said Randal, pausing by the
table.</p>

<p>"One you have read, of course,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
replied Mrs Dale, putting a bookmark
embroidered by herself into
the page, and handing the volume to
Randal. "It has made a great sensation,
I believe."</p>

<p>Randal glanced at the title of the
work. "True," said he, "I have
heard much of it in London, but I
have not yet had time to read it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"I can lend it to you,
if you like to look over it to-night,
and you can leave it for me with Mrs
Hazeldean."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (approaching.)&mdash;"Oh!
that book!&mdash;yes, you must read it.
I do not know a work more instructive."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Instructive! Certainly
I will read it then. But I thought it
was a mere work of amusement&mdash;of
fancy. It seems so, as I look over it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"So is the <cite>Vicar of
Wakefield</cite>; yet what book more instructive?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"I should not have
said <em>that</em> of the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>.
A pretty book enough, though the
story is most improbable. But how is
it instructive?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"By its results: it leaves
us happier and better. What can
any instruction do more? Some
works instruct through the head, some
through the heart; the last reach the
widest circle, and often produce the
most genial influence on the character.
This book belongs to the last. You
will grant my proposition when you
have read it."</p>

<p>Randal smiled and took the volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"Is the author known
yet?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"I have heard it ascribed
to many writers, but I believe
no one has claimed it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"I think it must have
been written by my old college friend,
Professor Moss, the naturalist; its descriptions
of scenery are so accurate."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"La, Charles dear!
that snuffy, tiresome, prosy professor?
How can you talk such nonsense? I
am sure the author must be young;
there is so much freshness of feeling."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean</span>, (positively.)&mdash;"Yes,
certainly young."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, (no less positively.)&mdash;"I
should say just the contrary. Its
tone is too serene, and its style too
simple for a young man. Besides, I
don't know any young man who would
send me his book, and this book has
been sent me&mdash;very handsomely bound
too, you see. Depend upon it, Moss
is the man&mdash;quite his turn of mind."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"You are too provoking,
Charles dear! Mr Moss is
so remarkably plain, too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Must an author be
handsome?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Ha, ha! Answer that,
if you can, Carry."</p>

<p>Carry remained mute and disdainful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire</span>, (with great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naiveté</i>.)&mdash;"Well,
I don't think there's much in
the book, whoever wrote it; for I've
read it myself, and understand every
word of it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"I don't see why you
should suppose it was written by a
man at all. For my part, I think it
must be a woman."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"Yes, there's
a passage about maternal affection,
which only a woman could have
written."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"Pooh, pooh! I should
like to see a woman who could have
written that description of an August
evening before a thunderstorm;
every wildflower in the hedgerow
exactly the flowers of August&mdash;every
sign in the air exactly those of
the month. Bless you! a woman
would have filled the hedge with
violets and cowslips. Nobody else
but my friend Moss could have written
that description."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire.</span>&mdash;"I don't know; there's
a simile about the waste of corn-seed
in hand-sowing, which makes me
think he must be a farmer!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span>, (scornfully.)&mdash;"A farmer!
In hob-nailed shoes, I suppose!
I say it is a woman."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"A <small>WOMAN</small>,
and <small>A MOTHER</small>!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parson.</span>&mdash;"A middle-aged man,
and a naturalist."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire.</span>&mdash;"No, no, Parson; certainly
a young man; for that love-scene
puts me in mind of my own
young days, when I would have given
my ears to tell Harry how handsome
I thought her; and all I could say
was&mdash;'Fine weather for the crops,
Miss.' Yes, a young man, and a
farmer. I should not wonder if he
had held the plough himself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>, (who had been turning
over the pages.)&mdash;"This sketch of
Night in London comes from a man
who has lived the life, of cities, and
looked at wealth with the eyes of
poverty. Not bad! I will read the
book."</p>

<p>"Strange," said the Parson, smiling,
"that this little work should so
have entered into our minds, suggested
to all of us different ideas, yet
equally charmed all&mdash;given a new and
fresh current to our dull country life&mdash;animated
us as with the sight of
a world in our breasts we had
never seen before, save in dreams;&mdash;a
little work like this, by a man we
don't know, and never may! Well,
<em>that</em> knowledge <em>is</em> power, and a noble
one!"</p>

<p>"A sort of power, certainly, sir,"
said Randal, candidly; and that
night, when Randal retired to his
own room, he suspended his schemes
and projects, and read, as he rarely
did, without an object to gain by the
reading.</p>

<p>The work surprised him by the
pleasure it gave. Its charm lay in
the writer's calm enjoyment of the
Beautiful. It seemed like some happy
soul sunning itself in the light of
its own thoughts. Its power was so
tranquil and even, that it was only a
critic who could perceive how much
force and vigour were necessary
to sustain the wing that floated aloft
with so imperceptible an effort.
There was no one faculty predominating
tyrannically over the others; all
seemed proportioned in the felicitous
symmetry of a nature rounded, integral,
and complete. And when the
work was closed, it left behind it a
tender warmth that played round the
heart of the reader, and vivified feelings
that seemed unknown before.
Randal laid down the book softly;
and for five minutes the ignoble and
base purposes to which his own knowledge
was applied, stood before him,
naked and unmasked.</p>

<p>"Tut," said he, wrenching himself
violently away from the benign influence,
"it was not to sympathise with
Hector, but to conquer with Achilles,
that Alexander of Macedon kept
Homer under his pillow. Such should
be the true use of books to him who
has the practical world to subdue; let
parsons and women construe it otherwise
as they may!"</p>

<p>And the Principle of Evil descended
again upon the intellect,
from which the guide of beneficence
was gone.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<p>Randal rose at the sound of the
first breakfast bell, and on the staircase
met Mrs Hazeldean. He gave
her back the book; and as he was
about to speak, she beckoned to him
to follow her into a little morning-room
appropriated to herself. No
boudoir of white and gold, with pictures
by Watteau, but lined with
large walnut-tree presses, that held
the old heirloom linen strewed with
lavender&mdash;stores for the housekeeper,
and medicines for the poor.</p>

<p>Seating herself on a large chair in
this sanctum, Mrs Hazeldean looked
formidably at home.</p>

<p>"Pray," said the lady, coming at
once to the point, with her usual
straightforward candour, "what is
all this you have been saying to my
husband as to the possibility of Frank's
marrying a foreigner?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Would you be as
averse to such a notion as Mr Hazeldean
is?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"You ask me
a question, instead of answering
mine."</p>

<p>Randal was greatly put out in his
fence by these rude thrusts. For indeed
he had a double purpose to serve&mdash;first
thoroughly to know if Frank's
marriage with a woman like Madame
di Negra would irritate the Squire
sufficiently to endanger the son's inheritance;
and, secondly, to prevent
Mr and Mrs Hazeldean believing,
seriously that such a marriage was to
be apprehended, lest they should prematurely
address Frank on the subject,
and frustrate the marriage itself. Yet,
withal, he must so express himself,
that he could not be afterwards accused
by the parents of disguising
matters. In his talk to the Squire
the preceding day, he had gone a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
too far&mdash;farther than he would have
done but for his desire of escaping the
cattle-shed and short-horns. While
he mused, Mrs Hazeldean observed
him with her honest sensible eyes,
and finally exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Out with it, Mr Leslie!"</p>

<p>"Out with what, my dear madam?
The Squire has sadly exaggerated the
importance of what was said mainly
in jest. But I will own to you plainly,
that Frank has appeared to me a little
smitten with a certain fair Italian."</p>

<p>"Italian!" cried Mrs Hazeldean.
"Well, I said so from the first. Italian!&mdash;that's
all, is it?" and she
smiled.</p>

<p>Randal was more and more perplexed.
The pupil of his eye contracted,
as it does when we retreat
into ourselves, and think, watch, and
keep guard.</p>

<p>"And perhaps," resumed Mrs
Hazeldean, with a very sunny expression
of countenance, "you have noticed
this in Frank since he was
here?"</p>

<p>"It is true," murmured Randal;
"but I think his heart or his fancy
was touched even before."</p>

<p>"Very natural," said Mrs Hazeldean;
"how could he help it?&mdash;such
a beautiful creature! Well, I must
not ask you to tell Frank's secrets;
but I guess the object of attraction;
and though she will have no fortune
to speak of&mdash;and it is not such a
match as he might form&mdash;still she
is so amiable, and has been so well
brought up, and is so little like one's
general notions of a Roman Catholic,
that I think I could persuade Hazeldean
into giving his consent."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Randal, drawing a
long breath, and beginning with his
practised acuteness to detect Mrs
Hazeldean's error, "I am very much
relieved and rejoiced to hear this; and
I may venture to give Frank some
hope, if I find him disheartened and
desponding, poor fellow!"</p>

<p>"I think you may," replied Mrs
Hazeldean, laughing pleasantly. "But
you should not have frightened poor
William so, hinting that the lady
knew very little English. She has
an accent, to be sure; but she speaks
our tongue very prettily. I always
forget that she's not English born!
Ha, ha, poor William!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"We had once
thought of another match for Frank&mdash;a
girl of good English family."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Miss Sticktorights?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"No; that's
an old whim of Hazeldean's. But
he knows very well that the Sticktorights
would never merge their property
in ours. Bless you, it would
be all off the moment they came to
settlements, and had to give up the
right of way. We thought of a
very different match; but there's no
dictating to young hearts, Mr Leslie."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal.</span>&mdash;"Indeed no, Mrs Hazeldean.
But since we now understand
each other so well, excuse me if I
suggest that you had better leave
things to themselves, and not write
to Frank on the subject. Young
hearts, you know, are often stimulated
by apparent difficulties, and grow
cool when the obstacle vanishes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Hazeldean.</span>&mdash;"Very possibly;
it was not so with Hazeldean and
me. But I shall not write to Frank
on the subject, for a different reason&mdash;though
I would consent to the match,
and so would William; yet we both
would rather, after all, that Frank
married an Englishwoman, and a
Protestant. We will not, therefore,
do anything to encourage the idea.
But if Frank's happiness becomes
really at stake, <em>then</em> we will step in.
In short, we would neither encourage
nor oppose. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"And, in the meanwhile, it is
quite right that Frank should see
the world, and try to distract his
mind, or at least to know it. And
I dare say it has been some thought
of that kind which has prevented his
coming here."</p>

<p>Randal, dreading a farther and
plainer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</i>, now rose,
and saying, "Pardon me, but I
must hurry over breakfast, and be
back in time to catch the coach"&mdash;offered
his arm to his hostess, and
led her into the breakfast-parlour.
Devouring his meal, as if in great
haste, he then mounted his horse,
and, taking cordial leave of his entertainers,
trotted briskly away.</p>

<p>All things favoured his project&mdash;even
chance had befriended him in
Mrs Hazeldean's mistake. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
not unnaturally supposed Violante to
have captivated Frank on his last
visit to the Hall. Thus, while Randal
had certified his own mind that
nothing could more exasperate the
Squire than an alliance with Madame
di Negra, he could yet assure Frank
that Mrs Hazeldean was all on his
side. And when the error was discovered,
Mrs Hazeldean would only
have to blame herself for it. Still
more successful had his diplomacy
proved with the Riccaboccas; he
had ascertained the secret he had
come to discover; he should induce
the Italian to remove to the neighbourhood
of London; and if Violante
were the great heiress he suspected
her to prove, whom else of her own
age would she see but him? And
the old Leslie domains&mdash;to be sold
in two years&mdash;a portion of the
dowry might purchase them! Flushed
by the triumph of his craft, all former
vacillations of conscience ceased.
In high and fervent spirits he passed
the Casino, the garden of which was
solitary and deserted, reached his
home, and, telling Oliver to be
studious, and Juliet to be patient,
walked thence to meet the coach and
regain the capital.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<p>Violante was seated in her own
little room, and looking from the window
on the terrace that stretched
below. The day was warm for the
time of year. The orange-trees had
been removed under shelter for the
approach of winter; but where they
had stood sate Mrs Riccabocca at
work. In the Belvidere, Riccabocca
himself was conversing with
his favourite servant. But the casements
and the door of the Belvidere
were open; and where they sate,
both wife and daughter could see the
Padrone leaning against the wall,
with his arms folded, and his eyes
fixed on the floor; while Jackeymo,
with one finger on his master's arm,
was talking to him with visible earnestness.
And the daughter from
the window, and the wife from her
work, directed tender anxious eyes
towards the still thoughtful form so
dear to both. For the last day or
two, Riccabocca had been peculiarly
abstracted, even to gloom. Each felt
there was something stirring at his
heart&mdash;neither as yet knew what.</p>

<p>Violante's room silently revealed the
nature of the education by which her
character had been formed. Save
a sketch-book which lay open on a
desk at hand, and which showed
talent exquisitely taught, (for in this
Riccabocca had been her teacher,)
there was nothing that spoke of the
ordinary female accomplishments. No
piano stood open, no harp occupied
yon nook, which seemed made for
one; no broidery frame, nor implements
of work, betrayed the usual
and graceful resources of a girl; but
ranged on shelves against the wall were
the best writers in English, Italian,
and French; and these betokened an
extent of reading, that he who wishes
for a companion to his mind in the
sweet commune of woman, which
softens and refines all it gives and
takes in interchange, will never condemn
as masculine. You had but to
look into Violante's face to see how
noble was the intelligence that brought
soul to those lovely features. Nothing
hard, nothing dry and stern was there.
Even as you detected knowledge, it
was lost in the gentleness of grace.
In fact, whatever she gained in the
graver kinds of information, became
transmuted, through her heart and
her fancy, into spiritual golden stores.
Give her some tedious and arid history,
her imagination seized upon
beauties other readers had passed by,
and, like the eye of the artist, detected
everywhere the Picturesque.
Something in her mind seemed to
reject all that was mean and commonplace,
and to bring out all that
was rare and elevated in whatever it
received. Living so apart from all
companions of her age, she scarcely
belonged to the Present time. She
dwelt in the Past, as Sabrina, in her
crystal well. Images of chivalry&mdash;of
the Beautiful and the Heroic&mdash;such
as, in reading the silvery line of
Tasso, rise before us, softening force
and valour into love and song&mdash;haunted
the reveries of the fair Italian maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell us not that the Past, examined
by cold Philosophy, was no better
and no loftier than the Present; it is
not thus seen by pure and generous
eyes. Let the Past perish, when it
ceases to reflect on its magic mirror
the beautiful Romance which is its
noblest reality, though perchance but
the shadow of Delusion.</p>

<p>Yet Violante was not merely the
dreamer. In her, life was so puissant
and rich, that action seemed necessary
to its glorious development&mdash;action,
but still in the woman's sphere&mdash;action
to bless and to refine and to exalt all
around her, and to pour whatever else
of ambition was left unsatisfied into
sympathy with the aspirations of
man. Despite her father's fears of
the bleak air of England, in that air
she had strengthened the delicate
health of her childhood. Her elastic
step&mdash;her eyes full of sweetness and
light&mdash;her bloom, at once soft and
luxuriant&mdash;all spoke of the vital
powers fit to sustain a mind of such
exquisite mould, and the emotions of
a heart that, once aroused, could ennoble
the passions of the South
with the purity and devotion of the
North.</p>

<p>Solitude makes some natures more
timid, some more bold. Violante was
fearless. When she spoke, her eyes
frankly met your own; and she was
so ignorant of evil, that as yet she
seemed nearly unacquainted with
shame. From this courage, combined
with affluence of idea, came a delightful
flow of happy converse. Though
possessing so imperfectly the accomplishments
ordinarily taught to young
women, and which may be cultured
to the utmost, and yet leave the
thoughts so barren, and the talk so
vapid&mdash;she had that accomplishment
which most pleases the taste, and commands
the love, of the man of talent;
especially if his talent be not so actively
employed as to make him desire
only relaxation where he seeks companionship&mdash;the
accomplishment of
facility in intellectual interchange&mdash;the
charm that clothes in musical
words beautiful womanly ideas.</p>

<p>"I hear him sigh at this distance,"
said Violante softly, as she still
watched her father; "and methinks
this is a new grief, and not for his
country. He spoke twice yesterday
of that dear English friend, and
wished that he were here."</p>

<p>As she said this, unconsciously the
virgin blushed, her hands drooped on
her knee, and she fell herself into
thought as profound as her father's,
but less gloomy. From her arrival
in England, Violante had been taught
a grateful interest in the name of
Harley L'Estrange. Her father, preserving
a silence, that seemed disdain,
of all his old Italian intimates,
had been pleased to converse with
open heart of the Englishman who
had saved where countrymen had
betrayed. He spoke of the soldier,
then in the full bloom of youth,
who, unconsoled by fame, had nursed
the memory of some hidden sorrow
amidst the pine-trees that cast their
shadow over the sunny Italian lake;
how Riccabocca, then honoured and
happy, had courted from his seclusion
the English Signor, then the
mourner and the voluntary exile;
how they had grown friends amidst
the landscapes in which her eyes had
opened to the day; how Harley
had vainly warned him from the rash
schemes in which he had sought to reconstruct
in an hour the ruins of weary
ages; how, when abandoned, deserted,
proscribed, pursued, he had fled for
life&mdash;the infant Violante clasped to
his bosom&mdash;the English soldier had
given him refuge, baffled the pursuers,
armed his servants, accompanied the
fugitive at night towards the defile in
the Apennines, and, when the emissaries
of a perfidious enemy, hot in
the chase, came near, had said, "You
have your child to save! Fly on!
Another league, and you are beyond
the borders. We will delay the foes
with parley; they will not harm us."
And not till escape was gained did
the father know that the English
friend had delayed the foe, not by
parley, but by the sword, holding the
pass against numbers, with a breast
as dauntless as Bayard's in the immortal
bridge.</p>

<p>And since then, the same Englishman
had never ceased to vindicate
his name, to urge his cause, and if
hope yet remained of restoration to
land and honours, it was in that
untiring zeal.</p>

<p>Hence, naturally and insensibly,
this secluded and musing girl had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
associated all that she read in tales
of romance and chivalry with the
image of the brave and loyal stranger.
He it was who animated her dreams
of the Past, and seemed born to be, in
the destined hour, the deliverer of the
Future. Around this image grouped
all the charms that the fancy of virgin
woman can raise from the enchanted
lore of old Heroic Fable. Once in her
early girlhood, her father (to satisfy
her curiosity, eager for general description)
had drawn from memory a
sketch of the features of the Englishman&mdash;drawn
Harley, as he was in
that first youth, flattered and idealised,
no doubt, by art and by partial
gratitude&mdash;but still resembling him
as he was then; while the deep
mournfulness of recent sorrow yet
shadowed and concentrated all the
varying expression of his countenance;
and to look on him was to
say,&mdash;"So sad, yet so young!" Never
did Violante pause to remember that
the same years which ripened herself
from infancy into woman, were passing
less gently over that smooth
cheek and dreamy brow&mdash;that the
world might be altering the nature,
as time the aspect. To her, the hero
of the Ideal remained immortal in
bloom and youth. Bright illusion,
common to us all, where Poetry once
hallows the human form! Who ever
thinks of Petrarch as the old time-worn
man? Who does not see him as when
he first gazed on Laura?&mdash;</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<p>And Violante, thus absorbed in
reverie, forgot to keep watch on the
Belvidere. And the Belvidere was
now deserted. The wife, who had no
other ideal to distract <em>her</em> thoughts,
saw Riccabocca pass into the house.</p>

<p>The exile entered his daughter's
room, and she started to feel his hand
upon her locks and his kiss upon her
brow.</p>

<p>"My child!" cried Riccabocca,
seating himself, "I have resolved to
leave for a time this retreat, and to
seek the neighbourhood of London."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear father, <em>that</em>, then, was
your thought? But what can be
your reason? Do not turn away; you
know how carefully I have obeyed
your command and kept your secret.
Ah, you will confide in me."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," returned Riccabocca,
with emotion. "I leave this place,
in the fear lest my enemies discover
me. I shall say to others that you
are of an age to require teachers, not
to be obtained here. But I should
like none to know where we go."</p>

<p>The Italian said these last words
through his teeth, and hanging his
head. He said them in shame.</p>

<p>"My mother&mdash;(so Violante always
called Jemima)&mdash;my mother, you
have spoken to her?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. <em>There</em> is the difficulty."</p>

<p>"No difficulty, for she loves you so
well," replied Violante, with soft
reproach. "Ah, why not also confide
in her? Who so true? so
good?"</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;I grant it!" exclaimed
Riccabocca. "What then? 'Da cattiva
Donna guardati, ed alla buona non
fidar niente,' (from the bad woman,
guard thyself; to the good woman
trust nothing.) And if you must trust,"
added the abominable man, "trust
her with anything but a secret!"</p>

<p>"Fie," said Violante, with arch
reproach, for she knew her father's
humours too well to interpret his
horrible sentiments literally&mdash;"fie
on your consistency, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Padre carissimo</i>.
Do you not trust your secret to me?"</p>

<p>"You! A kitten is not a cat, and
a girl is not a woman. Besides, the
secret was already known to you,
and I had no choice. Peace, Jemima
will stay here for the present. See
to what you wish to take with you;
we shall leave to-night."</p>

<p>Not waiting for an answer, Riccabocca
hurried away, and with a firm
step strode the terrace and approached
his wife.</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima mia</i>," said the pupil of
Machiavel, disguising in the tenderest
words the cruellest intentions&mdash;for
one of his most cherished Italian proverbs
was to the effect, that there is
no getting on with a mule or a woman
unless you coax them&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima mia</i>,&mdash;soul
of my being&mdash;you have already
seen that Violante mopes herself to
death here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span></p>

<p>"She, poor child! Oh no!"</p>

<p>"She does, core of my heart, she
does, and is as ignorant of music as I
am of tent-stitch."</p>

<p>"She sings beautifully."</p>

<p>"Just as birds do, against all the
rules, and in defiance of gamut.
Therefore, to come to the point, O
treasure of my soul! I am going to
take her with me for a short time,
perhaps to Cheltenham, or Brighton&mdash;we
shall see."</p>

<p>"All places with you are the same
to me, Alphonso. When shall we go?"</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> shall go to-night; but, terrible
as it is to part from you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted the wife, and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Riccabocca, the wiliest and most relentless
of men in his maxims, melted
into absolute uxorial imbecility at the
sight of that mute distress. He put
his arm round his wife's waist, with
genuine affection, and without a
single proverb at his heart&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carissima</i>,
do not grieve so; we shall be
back soon, and travelling is expensive;
rolling stones gather no moss, and
there is so much to see to at home."</p>

<p>Mrs Riccabocca gently escaped
from her husband's arms. She withdrew
her hands from her face, and
brushed away the tears that stood in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Alphonso," she said touchingly,
"hear me! What you think good,
that shall ever be good to me. But
do not think that I grieve solely
because of our parting. No; I grieve
to think that, despite all these years
in which I have been the partner of
your hearth and slept on your breast&mdash;all
these years in which I have had
no thought but, however humbly, to
do my duty to you and yours, and
could have wished that you had read
my heart, and seen there but yourself
and your child&mdash;I grieve to
think that you still deem me as unworthy
your trust as when you stood
by my side at the altar."</p>

<p>"Trust!" repeated Riccabocca,
startled and conscience-stricken;
"why do you say 'trust?' In what
have I distrusted you? I am sure," he
continued, with the artful volubility
of guilt, "that I never doubted your
fidelity&mdash;hook-nosed, long-visaged
foreigner though I be; never pryed
into your letters; never inquired into
your solitary walks; never heeded
your flirtations with that good-looking
Parson Dale; never kept the
money; and never looked into the
account-books!" Mrs Riccabocca refused
even a smile of contempt at
these revolting evasions; nay, she
seemed scarcely to hear them.</p>

<p>"Can you think," she resumed,
pressing her hand on her heart to
still its struggles for relief in sobs&mdash;"can
you think that I could have
watched, and thought, and tasked my
poor mind so constantly, to conjecture
what might best soothe or please you,
and not seen, long since, that you
have secrets known to your daughter&mdash;your
servant&mdash;not to me? Fear not&mdash;the
secrets cannot be evil, or you
would not tell them to your innocent
child. Besides, do I not know your
nature? and do I not love you because
I know it?&mdash;it is for something connected
with these secrets that you
leave your home. You think that I
should be incautious&mdash;imprudent.
You will not take me with you. Be it
so. I go to prepare for your departure.
Forgive me if I have displeased you,
husband."</p>

<p>Mrs Riccabocca turned away; but
a soft hand touched the Italian's arm.
"O father, can you resist this?
Trust her!&mdash;trust her! I am a woman
like her! I answer for her woman's
faith. Be yourself&mdash;ever nobler than
all others, my own father."</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diavolo!</i> Never one door shuts
but another opens," groaned Riccabocca.
"Are you a fool, child? Don't
you see that it was for your sake only
I feared&mdash;and would be cautious?"</p>

<p>"For mine! O then, do not make
me deem myself mean, and the cause
of meanness. For mine! Am I not
your daughter&mdash;the descendant of
men who never feared?"</p>

<p>Violante looked sublime while she
spoke; and as she ended she led her
father gently on towards the door,
which his wife had now gained.</p>

<p>"Jemima&mdash;wife mine!&mdash;pardon,
pardon," cried the Italian, whose
heart had been yearning to repay such
tenderness and devotion,&mdash;"come
back to my breast&mdash;it has been long
closed&mdash;it shall be open to you now
and for ever."</p>

<p>In another moment, the wife was
in her right place&mdash;on her husband's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
bosom; and Violante, beautiful peace-maker,
stood smiling a while at both,
and then lifted her eyes gratefully to
heaven, and stole away.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIII.</h4>

<p>On Randal's return to town, he
heard mixed and contradictory rumours
in the streets, and at the clubs
of the probable downfall of the Government
at the approaching session
of Parliament. These rumours had
sprung up suddenly, as if in an hour.
True that, for some time, the sagacious
had shaken their heads and said,
"Ministers could not last." True
that certain changes in policy, a year
or two before, had divided the party
on which the Government depended,
and strengthened that which opposed
it. But still its tenure in office had
been so long, and there seemed so
little power in the Opposition to form
a cabinet of names familiar to official
ears, that the general public had anticipated,
at most, a few partial changes.
Rumour now went far beyond this.
Randal, whose whole prospects at
present were but reflections from the
greatness of his patron, was alarmed.
He sought Egerton, but the minister
was impenetrable, and seemed calm,
confident, and imperturbed. Somewhat
relieved, Randal then set himself
to work to find a safe home for
Riccabocca; for the greater need
to succeed in obtaining fortune there,
if he failed in getting it through Egerton.
He found a quiet house, detached
and secluded, in the neighbourhood
of Norwood. No vicinity
more secure from espionage and remark.
He wrote to Riccabocca, and
communicated the address, adding
fresh assurances of his own power to
be of use. The next morning he was
seated in his office, thinking very
little of the details, that he mastered,
however, with mechanical precision,
when the minister who presided over
that department of the public service
sent for him into his private room, and
begged him to take a letter to Egerton,
with whom he wished to consult relative
to a very important point to be
decided in the Cabinet that day. "I
want you to take it," said the minister
smiling, (the minister was a frank,
homely man,) "because you are in Mr
Egerton's confidence, and he may give
you some verbal message besides a
written reply. Egerton is often over
cautious and brief in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litera scripta</i>."</p>

<p>Randal went first to Egerton's
neighbouring office&mdash;he had not been
there that day. He then took a
cabriolet and drove to Grosvenor
Square. A quiet-looking chariot was
at the door. Mr Egerton was at
home; but the servant said, "Dr F.
is with him, sir; and perhaps he may
not like to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"What, is your master ill?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, sir. He never
says he is ill. But he has looked
poorly the last day or two."</p>

<p>Randal hesitated a moment; but
his commission might be important,
and Egerton was a man who so held
the maxim, that health and all else
must give way to business, that he
resolved to enter; and, unannounced,
and unceremoniously, as was his wont,
he opened the door of the library.
He started as he did so. Audley
Egerton was leaning back on the sofa,
and the doctor, on his knees before
him, was applying the stethoscope to
his breast. Egerton's eyes were partially
closed as the door opened. But
at the noise he sprang up, nearly
oversetting the doctor. "Who's
that?&mdash;How dare you!" he exclaimed,
in a voice of great anger. Then
recognising Randal, he changed colour,
bit his lip, and muttered drily,
"I beg pardon for my abruptness;
what do you want, Mr Leslie?"</p>

<p>"This letter from Lord &mdash;&mdash;; I was
told to deliver it immediately into
your own hands; I beg pardon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no cause," said Egerton,
coldly. "I have had a slight attack of
bronchitis; and as Parliament meets so
soon, I must take advice from my doctor,
if I would be heard by the reporters.
Lay the letter on the table, and
be kind enough to wait for my reply."</p>

<p>Randal withdrew. He had never
seen a physician in that house before,
and it seemed surprising that Egerton
should even take a medical opinion
upon a slight attack. While waiting
in the ante-room there was a knock at
the street door, and presently a gentleman,
exceedingly well dressed, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
shown in, and honoured Randal with
an easy and half familiar bow. Randal
remembered to have met this personage
at dinner, and at the house of
a young nobleman of high fashion, but
had not been introduced to him, and
did not even know him by name. The
visitor was better informed.</p>

<p>"Our friend Egerton is busy, I
hear, Mr Leslie," said he, arranging
the camelia in his button hole.</p>

<p>"Our friend Egerton!" It must be
a very great man to say, "Our friend
Egerton."</p>

<p>"He will not be engaged long, I
dare say," returned Randal, glancing
his shrewd inquiring eye over the
stranger's person.</p>

<p>"I trust not; my time is almost as
precious as his own. I was not so
fortunate as to be presented to you
when we met at Lord Spendquick's.
Good fellow, Spendquick; and decidedly
clever."</p>

<p>Lord Spendquick was usually esteemed
a gentleman without three ideas.</p>

<p>Randal smiled.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the visitor had
taken out a card from an embossed
morocco case, and now presented it
to Randal, who read thereon, "Baron
Levy, No. &mdash;, Bruton St."</p>

<p>The name was not unknown to
Randal. It was a name too often on
the lips of men of fashion not to have
reached the ears of an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitué</i> of good
society.</p>

<p>Mr Levy had been a solicitor by
profession. He had of late years relinquished
his ostensible calling; and
not long since, in consequence of some
services towards the negotiation of a
loan, had been created a baron by one
of the German kings. The wealth of
Mr Levy was said to be only equalled
by his good nature to all who were in
want of a temporary loan, and with
sound expectations of repaying it
some day or other.</p>

<p>You seldom saw a finer-looking man
than Baron Levy&mdash;about the same age
as Egerton, but looking younger: so
well preserved&mdash;such magnificent
black whiskers&mdash;such superb teeth!
Despite his name and his dark complexion,
he did not, however, resemble
a Jew&mdash;at least externally; and, in
fact, he was not a Jew on the father's
side, but the natural son of a
rich English <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand seigneur</i>, by a
Hebrew lady of distinction&mdash;in the
opera. After his birth, this lady had
married a German trader of her own
persuasion, and her husband had been
prevailed upon, for the convenience
of all parties, to adopt his wife's son,
and accord to him his own Hebrew
name. Mr Levy senior was soon
left a widower, and then the real
father, though never actually owning
the boy, had shown him great attention&mdash;had
him frequently at his house&mdash;initiated
him betimes into his own
high-born society, for which the boy
showed great taste. But when my
Lord died, and left but a moderate
legacy to the younger Levy, who was
then about eighteen, that ambiguous
person was articled to an attorney by
his putative sire, who shortly afterwards
returned to his native land, and
was buried at Prague, where his tombstone
may yet be seen. Young Levy,
however, continued to do very well
without him. His real birth was
generally known, and rather advantageous
to him in a social point of
view. His legacy enabled him to become
a partner where he had been a
clerk, and his practice became great
amongst the fashionable classes of
society. Indeed he was so useful, so
pleasant, so much a man of the world,
that he grew intimate with his clients&mdash;chiefly
young men of rank; was on
good terms with both Jew and Christian;
and being neither one nor the
other, resembled (to use Sheridan's
incomparable simile) the blank page between
the Old and the New Testament.</p>

<p>Vulgar, some might call Mr Levy,
from his assurance, but it was not the
vulgarity of a man accustomed to low
and coarse society&mdash;rather the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais
ton</i> of a person not sure of his
own position, but who has resolved to
swagger into the best one he can get.
When it is remembered that he had
made his way in the world, and
gleaned together an immense fortune,
it is needless to add that he was as
sharp as a needle, and as hard as a
flint. No man had had more friends,
and no man had stuck by them more
firmly&mdash;as long as there was a pound
in their pockets!</p>

<p>Something of this character had
Randal heard of the Baron, and he
now gazed, first at his card, and then
at him, with&mdash;admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span></p>

<p>"I met a friend of yours at Borrowwell's
the other day," resumed the
Baron&mdash;"Young Hazeldean. Careful
fellow&mdash;quite a man of the world."</p>

<p>As this was the last praise poor
Frank deserved, Randal again smiled.</p>

<p>The Baron went on&mdash;"I hear, Mr
Leslie, that you have much influence
over this same Hazeldean. His
affairs are in a sad state. I should
be very happy to be of use to him, as
a relation of my friend Egerton's; but
he understands business so well that
he despises my advice."</p>

<p>"I am sure you do him injustice."</p>

<p>"Injustice! I honour his caution.
I say to every man, 'Don't come to
me&mdash;I can get you money on much
easier terms than any one else;' and
what's the result? You come so often
that you ruin yourself; whereas a regular
usurer without conscience frightens
you. 'Cent per cent,' you say; 'oh,
I must pull in.' If you have influence
over your friend, tell him to stick to
his bill-brokers, and have nothing to
do with Baron Levy."</p>

<p>Here the minister's bell rung, and
Randal, looking through the window,
saw Dr F. walking to his carriage,
which had made way for Baron Levy's
splendid cabriolet&mdash;a cabriolet in the
most perfect taste&mdash;Baron's coronet
on the dark brown panels&mdash;horse black,
with such action!&mdash;harness just relieved
with plating. The servant now
entered, and requested Randal to step
in; and addressing the Baron, assured
him that he would not be detained a minute.</p>

<p>"Leslie," said the minister, sealing a
note, "take this back to Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and
say that I shall be with him in an hour."</p>

<p>"No other message?&mdash;he seemed
to expect one."</p>

<p>"I dare say he did. Well, my
letter is official, my message is not;
beg him to see Mr &mdash;&mdash; before we
meet&mdash;he will understand&mdash;all rests
upon that interview."</p>

<p>Egerton then, extending the letter,
resumed gravely, "Of course you will
not mention to any one that Dr F.
was with me: the health of public
men is not to be suspected. Hum&mdash;were
you in your own room or the
ante-room?"</p>

<p>"The ante-room, sir."</p>

<p>Egerton's brow contracted slightly.
"And Mr Levy was there, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the Baron."</p>

<p>"Baron! true. Come to plague
me about the Mexican loan, I suppose.
I will keep you no longer."</p>

<p>Randal, much meditating, left the
house, and re-entered his hack cab.
The Baron was admitted to the statesman's
presence.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIV.</h4>

<p>Egerton had thrown himself at full
length on the sofa, a position exceedingly
rare with him; and about his
whole air and manner, as Levy entered,
there was something singularly
different from that stateliness of port
common to the austere legislator.
The very tone of his voice was
different. It was as if the statesman&mdash;the
man of business&mdash;had
vanished; it was rather the man of
fashion and the idler, who, nodding
languidly to his visitor, said, "Levy,
what money can I have for a
year?"</p>

<p>"The estate will bear very little
more. My dear fellow, that last election
was the very devil. You cannot
go on thus much longer."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" Baron Levy
hailed Audley Egerton as "my dear
fellow." And Audley Egerton, perhaps,
saw nothing strange in the
words, though his lip curled.</p>

<p>"I shall not want to go on thus
much longer," answered Egerton, as
the curl on his lip changed to a
gloomy smile. "The estate must,
meanwhile, bear £5000 more."</p>

<p>"A hard pull on it. You had really
better sell."</p>

<p>"I cannot afford to sell at present.
I cannot afford men to say, 'Audley
Egerton is done up&mdash;his property is
for sale.'"</p>

<p>"It is very sad when one thinks
what a rich man you have been&mdash;and
may be yet!"</p>

<p>"Be yet! How?"</p>

<p>Baron Levy glanced towards the
thick mahogany doors&mdash;thick and impervious,
as should be the doors of
statesmen. "Why, you know that,
with three words from you, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
produce an effect upon the stocks of
three nations, that might give as each
a hundred thousand pounds. We
would go shares."</p>

<p>"Levy," said Egerton coldly, though
a deep blush overspread his face,
"you are a scoundrel; that is your
look-out. I interfere with no man's
tastes and conscience. I don't intend
to be a scoundrel myself. I have told
you that long ago."</p>

<p>The Baron laughed, without evincing
the least displeasure.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "you are neither
wise nor complimentary, but you shall
have the money. But yet, would it
not be better," added Levy, with emphasis,
"to borrow it, without interest,
of your friend L'Estrange?"</p>

<p>Egerton started as if stung.</p>

<p>"You mean to taunt me, sir!" he
exclaimed, passionately. "I accept
pecuniary favours from Lord L'Estrange!
I!"</p>

<p>"Tut, my dear Egerton, I dare say
my Lord would not think so ill now
of that little act in your life which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold!" exclaimed Egerton, writhing.
"Hold!"</p>

<p>He stopped, and paced the room,
muttering in broken sentences, "To
blush before this man! Chastisement,
chastisement!"</p>

<p>Levy gazed on him with hard and
sinister eyes. The minister turned
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Look you, Levy," said he, with
forced composure&mdash;"you hate me&mdash;why,
I know not. I have never injured
you&mdash;never avenged the inexpiable
wrong you did me."</p>

<p>"Wrong!&mdash;you a man of the world!
Wrong! Call it so if you will, then,"
he added shrinkingly, for Audley's
brow grew terrible. "But have I not
atoned it? Would you ever have
lived in this palace, and ruled this
country as one of the most influential
of its ministers, but for my management&mdash;my
whispers to the wealthy
Miss Leslie? Come, but for me what
would you have been&mdash;perhaps a
beggar?"</p>

<p>"What shall I be now if I live?
<em>Then</em> I should not have been a beggar;
poor perhaps in money, but rich&mdash;rich
in all that now leaves my life
bankrupt. Gold has not thriven with
me; how should it? And this fortune&mdash;it
has passed for the main part into
your hands. Be patient, you will
have it all ere long. But there is one
man in the world who has loved me
from a boy, and woe to you if ever
he learn that he has the right to despise
me!"</p>

<p>"Egerton, my good fellow," said
Levy, with great composure, "you
need not threaten me, for what interest
can I possibly have in tale-telling
to Lord L'Estrange? As to hating
you&mdash;pooh! You snub me in private,
you cut me in public, you refuse to
come to my dinners, you'll not ask
me to your own; still, there is no
man I like better, nor would more
willingly serve. When do you want
the £5000?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps in one month, perhaps
not for three or four. Let it be ready
when required."</p>

<p>"Enough; depend on it. Have
you any other commands?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I will take my leave, then. By
the by, what do you suppose the
Hazeldean rental is worth&mdash;net?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, nor care. You
have no designs upon <em>that</em>, too?"</p>

<p>"Well, I like keeping up family
connections. Mr Frank seems a liberal
young gentleman."</p>

<p>Before Egerton could answer, the
Baron had glided to the door, and,
nodding pleasantly, vanished with
that nod.</p>

<p>Egerton remained, standing on his
solitary hearth. A drear, single man's
room it was, from wall to wall, despite
its fretted ceilings and official pomp
of Bramah escritoires and red boxes.
Drear and cheerless&mdash;no trace of woman's
habitation&mdash;no vestige of intruding,
happy children. There stood the
austere man alone. And then with a
deep sigh he muttered, "Thank heaven,
not for long&mdash;it will not last long."</p>

<p>Repeating those words, he mechanically
locked up his papers, and pressed
his hand to his heart for an instant,
as if a spasm had shot through it.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;I must shun all emotion!"
said he, shaking his head gently.</p>

<p>In five minutes more, Audley Egerton
was in the streets, his mien erect,
and his step firm as ever.</p>

<p>"That man is made of bronze,"
said a leader of the Opposition to a
friend as they rode past the minister.
"What would I give for his nerves!"</p>

<h2>JOHNSTON'S NOTES ON NORTH AMERICA.</h2>

<p><em>Notes on North America, Agricultural, Social, and Economical.</em> By <span class="smcap">James F. W.
Johnston</span>, M.A., F.R.SS.L. and E., &amp;c. Two Vols. post 8vo. William Blackwood
&amp; Sons.</p>


<p>Professor Johnston had three
objects in view in his visit to the New
World. His high reputation as an
agricultural chemist had induced the
Agricultural Society of New York to
request him to give a course of lectures
at Albany upon the connection of chemical
and geological science with that
of the cultivation of land. He had also
been commissioned by the Government
of New Brunswick to examine
and report on the agricultural capabilities
of that province. And besides
these public duties, he was impelled
by a strong desire to study the actual
position of the art of husbandry in the
fertile regions of the West, and the
influence which its progress is likely
to exert upon British agriculture.</p>

<p>Our shrewd brother Jonathan, however
brilliant his achievements have
been in other arts, has not hitherto
earned any great reputation as a scientific
farmer. Nature has been so bountiful
to him, that, with "fresh fields
and pastures new" ever before him,
he has hitherto had no need to resort
to the toilsome processes and anxious
expedients&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curis acuens mortalia
corda</i>"&mdash;of our Old World systems
of agriculture. On the newer lands
of the Union, at least, the rotations
followed, the waste of manures, and
the general contempt of all method
and economy, are such as would
break the heart of a Haddingtonshire
"grieve," and in a couple of seasons
convert his trim acres into a howling
wilderness. What would our respected
friend Mr Caird say to a course
of cropping like the following, which,
though given by Professor Johnston as
a specimen of New Brunswick farming,
is the usual method followed on
most of the new soils of North
America?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He cuts down the wood and burns
it, then takes a crop of potatoes, followed
by one of wheat, with grass seeds.
<em>Nine successive crops of hay follow in as
many years</em>; after which the stumps
are taken up, the land is ploughed, a
crop of wheat is taken; it is then
manured for the first time, or limed,
and laid down again for a similar succession
of crops of hay. This treatment
is hard enough; but the unskilful man,
after burning and spreading the ashes,
takes two or three more crops of grain,
leaves it to sow itself with grass, then
cuts hay as long as it bears a crop which
is worth cutting&mdash;after all which he
either stumps and ploughs it, or leaves
it to run again into the wilderness
state."&mdash;(<cite>Johnston</cite>, vol. i. p. 104.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a system seems, at first sight,
to argue a barbarous ignorance of the
very first elements of agriculture;
and yet, as Professor Johnston
remarks, "we English farmers and
teachers of agricultural science, with
all our skill, should probably, in the
same circumstances, do just the
same, so long as land was plenty,
labour scarce and dear, and markets
few and distant." Let no one suppose
that our wide-awake kinsman
does not know perfectly well what
he is about. His apparently rude
agricultural practice is regulated by
a maxim which some of our <i>Mechists</i>
at home would do well to bear in
mind&mdash;that high farming is bad
farming if it is not remunerative.
He knows that to manure his land
would be to insure the lodging and
destruction of his crops, and he
therefore leaves his straw to wither
in the fields, and lives on in blessed
ignorance of the virtues and cost of
guano. To plough deep furrows in
a virgin soil, saturated with organic
matter, would be an idle waste of
labour; and the primitive Triptolemus
of Michigan scatters the seed
upon the surface&mdash;or, raising a little
mould on the point of a hoe, drops
in a few grains of maize, covers
them over, and heeds them no more
till the golden pyramids are ripe for
the knife. The first three crops,
thus easily obtained, generally repay
to the settler in the wilderness the
expense of felling the timber, burning,
and cultivating. If he then abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
it, he is at least no loser; but for
eight or ten years the soil will still
continue to produce crops of natural
hay; and then, having extracted
from it all that its spontaneous
fertility will yield, he sells his possession
for what it may bring, and
moves off westward to repeat the
same exhaustive process on a fresh
portion of the forest, leaving to his
successor the task of reinvigorating
the severely tested powers of the soil
by rest and restoratives.</p>

<p>This locust-like progress of the
American settler&mdash;ever on the move
to new lands, and leaving comparative
barrenness in his track&mdash;must evidently
place the case of America
beyond the sphere of those ordinary
laws of political economy which are
applicable in European countries; and
Professor Johnston seems to consider
the fact of the incessant exhaustion
and abandonment of lands as the
chief key to a right understanding of
the peculiar economical position of
the United States. The owner of
land in the older and more populous
States, who has not learnt to apply
a restorative system of culture,
derives little benefit from the comparative
advantage of situation, while
the inhabitants of the towns and
villages around him are fed with the
surplus spontaneous produce of the
far off clearings in Ohio or Missouri.
But these in their turn become worn
out&mdash;and as cultivation travels on
westward, the chief centres of agricultural
production are gradually receding
farther and farther from the
chief centres of population and consumption;
and this increasing distance,
and consequent cost of transport,
is every year enhancing the price
of grain in the busy and crowded
marts of the West&mdash;ever filling up
with the incessant stream of immigration
from Europe. Such is Mr
Johnston's view of the present normal
condition of the Union in regard
to the sustenance of her people; and
he makes it the ground-work, as we
shall presently see, of certain rather
doubtful inferences, of some importance
in their bearing on the agriculture of
this country. One consequence, however,
of any material increase in the
price of food in the Eastern States of
the Union is very obvious&mdash;the proprietor
of land in these districts will
gradually be enabled to apply, with
profit to his exhausted soil, the artificial
aids and costlier system of culture
followed in Britain. Already this
result is apparent in Professor Johnston's
account of the energetic spirit
of agricultural improvement which is
rapidly spreading over most of the
New England States. In the keen,
restless, and enterprising New Englander,
our Old Country farmers will
undoubtedly find a more formidable
competitor, for the honour of the first
place in agricultural advancement,
than any they have yet met on this
side of the Atlantic. We have seen
this year what his invention can produce
in mechanical contrivances for
economising the labour of the field;
and, that he is not indifferent to the
aids which science can afford him, is
sufficiently proved by the occasion of
that visit to America of which Professor
Johnston has here given so pleasant
and instructive a record. The
invitation was not more creditable to
the character of the Professor, than to
the discernment of the zealous and
patriotic men who thus showed how
correctly they apprehend the true
method of improving their fine
country. His engagement was fulfilled
during the sitting of the State
Legislature at Albany in January
1850, when the hall of the Assembly
was given up to him as a lecture-room;
the leading members of the
Assembly and of the State Agricultural
Society were among his auditors,
and the greatest public interest was
evinced in the important subjects of
his prelections.</p>

<p>It is apparent, from many passages
of the <em>Notes</em>, that the author has
listened too confidingly to the flattering
tale&mdash;the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canor mulcendas natus
ad aures</i>" of the syren of Free Trade.
He seems to be gifted with a strong
natural faith, and a patriotic confidence
in what British enterprise, and
especially British agriculture, can
achieve in the way of surmounting
difficulties. It is not perhaps to be
wondered at that one, whose professional
pursuits naturally lead him to
place a high value upon the aids which
science has in store for the agriculturist,
should encourage the farmer
to think lightly of his present difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
and keep up his spirits with the
hope of some paulo-post-future prosperity.
It must be allowed that the
farmer, poor fellow, has not wanted
abundance of kind friends to comfort
him in his adversity. Generally,
however, their consolations&mdash;like
those of the sympathetic Mrs Gamp&mdash;have
been rather indefinite&mdash;vague
moralisings upon his calamity, as if
it were some inevitable stroke of Providence,
to be bowed to in silent
resignation, and hazy anticipations of
good luck awaiting him. Others,
again&mdash;who have professed the greatest
friendship for him, and, like the
Knight of Netherby, have come down
to hearten up the broken-down man
by imparting to him some plan of
theirs, as sheep-pasturage or the like,
for setting him on his legs again&mdash;are
mentally taking an inventory of
his remaining chattels, and calculating
when to send the sheriff's officer.
But Professor Johnston belongs to
neither of these classes of comforters.
His opinion, we know, is at least
disinterested, and he brings it before
us in the shape of a distinct proposition&mdash;viz.,
that the wheat-exporting
capabilities of the United States are
not so great as have generally been
supposed, and that, as they must
diminish rather than increase in
future, the prospect of competition
with American produce need cause no
alarm to the British farmer.</p>

<p>This opinion, coming from such
an authority, claims a deliberate
examination; and the more so that,
in the dearth of other gratulatory
topics, it has been eagerly laid hold
of by the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, the
<cite>Economist</cite>, and other Free-Trade
organs, and vaunted as a complete
proof that protective duties are quite
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The reasons which Professor Johnston
assigns for believing that the
<em>present</em> wheat-exporting powers of the
United States have been exaggerated,
may be passed over with very little
comment. The Board of Trade returns
leave no room for doubt as to
the quantity that has actually reached
this country, and it is therefore unnecessary
for us to follow him through
his hypothetical estimate of the exportable
grain, grounded on what
they <em>ought</em> to have had to spare for
us. We may remark, however, that
the data on which his calculations
proceed are far from satisfactory. He
shows that all the <em>wheat</em> produced in
the United States, as given in the
estimates of the Patent Office, is inadequate
to afford the eight bushels
which in England we reckon to be
requisite for the annual supply of
each inhabitant&mdash;the population of
the Union being about twenty-one
millions, and the produce of wheat one
hundred and twenty-seven millions
of bushels. He does not overlook
altogether the fact that wheat is
not in America, as it is with us, almost
the sole cereal food of the
people; and he admits that a considerable
allowance must be made
for the consumption of Indian corn
instead of wheat. But how much?&mdash;That
is the question. The compilers
of the State Papers at Washington
estimate that Indian corn, buckwheat,
and other grain, form so large a proportion
of the food of the people, that
they require only <em>three</em> bushels of
wheat per head; and no doubt they
have good grounds for this calculation.
Professor Johnston, however, without
indicating any reason whatever
for his assumption, has set down the
consumption of each individual at <em>five</em>
bushels per annum; and thus, by a
stroke of his pen, he reduces the average
exportable surplus of the Union
to <em>only</em> three millions of quarters.</p>

<p>As to what may be expected in future&mdash;Professor
Johnston anticipates
the gradual diminution of the supply,
from the circumstance, already adverted
to, of the progressive exhaustion
of the newer lands of the Union,
and the rapid increase of population
in the old. If several of the Western
States, he argues, have even already
ceased to raise enough wheat for the
supply of their present inhabitants,
and are compelled to draw largely on
the produce of the remote States of
Illinois, Ohio, &amp;c.&mdash;and if the productive
power of these new lands is
annually becoming less, the virgin
soils more distant, and the transport
of subsistence more difficult&mdash;if this
is the state of matters now, what
will it be in 1860, when immigration
and natural increase will probably
have raised the population of the
Union to some thirty-four millions?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
"It is very safe," he concludes, "to
say that in 1860 their wheat-exporting
capability will have become so
small as to give our British farmers
very little cause for apprehension." It
may perchance occur to these gentlemen,
that the consolation Professor
Johnston here offers them is not very
cheering after all; and as long as
they see the provision stores in every
market town piled up with the interloping
flour barrels of New York,
and their own waggons returning
home with their loads unsold, it is
not to be wondered at if they are
not greatly exhilarated with the
prospect of what may possibly happen
nine years hence. And slender
as is the hope deferred here held out
to them, it rests, we fear, on very
questionable grounds.</p>

<p>Professor Johnston's opinion is
founded on two suppositions: 1st,
That the exhaustion of the Western
States, on which he dwells so much, is
proceeding so rapidly as already to
affect the markets of the eastern districts;
2d, That these older districts
will be unable to increase the quantity
of produce raised within their own
boundaries, without so adding to its
cost as to prevent its being profitably
exported.</p>

<p>As to the first supposition, it may
be conceded that, in the course of
time, a period must necessarily come
when the spontaneous fertility of the
newer-settled States will cease to
yield grain with the same bountiful
abundance it has done hitherto. But,
when may that period be expected
to arrive?&mdash;to what extent has exhaustion
already taken place?&mdash;and
what is the rate of its progress? For
a reply, we have only to point to
that vast territory, bounded by the
lakes on the north and Ohio on the
south, comprising the five States of
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin&mdash;a territory eight times
the size of England and Wales, with
a population about equal to that
of Scotland, containing 180,000,000
acres of arable land, a large portion
of which is of surprising fertility&mdash;and
ask whether it is possible to
believe that it has already reached
the turning point of its wheat-productiveness,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
or can by any possibility
do so for centuries to come?
Why, the extent of land advertised
in these five States for sale, (which
forms only a fraction of what still
remains in the hands of government,)
is greater by a fourth than the whole
area of England; and of the territory
that has been actually sold, it is
estimated that five-sevenths is still
unreclaimed from the wilderness.
Then look at the means of transport
provided for conveying the overflowing
abundance of those rich
alluvial regions to the markets of the
East, by way of the two great outlets&mdash;the
lakes on the north, and the
Mississippi on the south. The cost of
such transport is no doubt considerable;
the conveyance of a quarter of
wheat from the centre of Illinois to
Boston, by New Orleans, averages
about 16s. 6d. But, nevertheless, so
trifling is the original cost of production,
that immense quantities of corn
do annually reach the eastern seaboard
by this route, a considerable
portion of which is re-shipped to
Liverpool, and sold there at prices
greatly below its cost of production
in this country. The annexed table<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
shows the remarkable fact, that, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
the whole quantity of grain exported
from the United States in the five
years 1842-6, twelve-thirteenths of
the wheat, about one-half of the
flour, and a large proportion of the
Indian corn, came from the two ports
of New York and Philadelphia alone.
Now, as we know that these large
supplies were not grown within the
confines of the Eastern States, and
<em>must</em> have been brought from the
westward, the inference is obvious
that the two causes insisted on by
Professor Johnston&mdash;the distance of
the virgin soils, and the expense of
transport&mdash;are as yet inoperative; or
at least that they have not prevented
the transmission of grain to the east
in such vast quantities, as not only
to meet the wants of all the population
of that part of the Union, but to
afford an average surplus for exportation
to other countries equivalent to
the annual maintenance of a million
and a half of men. We need only
mention one other fact, which seems
in itself a sufficient refutation of the
theory Professor Johnston has taken
up. The causes which he thinks are
so soon to dry up the supplies now derived
from the West are of no recent
or sudden emergence. The process
of exhaustion on the new lands, and
the rapid population of the old, has
been going on for many years. If,
then, these causes are so influential
as he imagines, their effects should at
least be apparent in a gradual increase
of the prices of bread-stuffs in
the Eastern States. Now, no such
effect is to be found. On the contrary,
we find that, during the last
twenty years, the price of wheat, as
well as of maize, in the chief marts
of the east, has been <em>steadily diminishing,
instead of increasing</em>. We extract
from the returns published by
the Board of Trade the annexed
comparison<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the prices of wheat
flour at New York, during two periods,
from which it appears that, in
the very State where the results of
Professor Johnston's hypothesis ought
to have been most manifest, the experience
of twenty years shows a reduction
of price instead of an enhancement,
notwithstanding that the latter
period in the comparison embraces
the years of the potato failure. An
examination of similar returns from
Baltimore and New Orleans establishes
the same fact, namely, that
the tendency of prices for twenty
years past is <em>not upwards, but downwards</em>&mdash;a
fact quite irreconcilable
with the supposed rapid exhaustion
of the wheat soils of the interior.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Professor
Johnston was unable to extend
his tour to these granary States of the
West. It would have been satisfactory
to have had from him an estimate
of their capabilities founded on
actual survey and personal observation,
instead of indirect inference.
We are quite ready to admit, that
many of the accounts of those regions
which have reached us, drawn up to
suit the purposes of speculators in
land, are of very dubious authenticity,
and, like the stage-coach in which
Mr Dickens travelled to Buffalo, have
"a pretty loud smell of varnish."
But, on the other hand, we cannot
discredit the official data supplied by
the State papers&mdash;without at least
stronger grounds than those inferences
from general geological structure
which Professor Johnston has adduced
to disprove the alleged fertility of the
State of Michigan. There can, of
course, be no more valuable criterion
of the natural agricultural value of a
country than is afforded by its geology&mdash;provided
the survey be sufficiently
extensive and accurate. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
it is difficult to follow those enthusiasts
in the science, whom we occasionally
find drawing the most startling
deductions from very narrow
data&mdash;and prophesying the future
history of the territory, and even the
character of its inhabitants, from a
glance at the bowels of the earth, as
the Roman augur foretold the fate
of empires from the entrails of his
chickens.</p>

<p>We find, for example, a writer of
high standing in America accounting
for a remarkable diminution in the
amount of <em>bastardy</em> in Pennsylvania,
some thirty years ago, by the fact&mdash;that
the settlers at that time <em>had got
off the cold clays and on to the limestone</em>!
A Scottish geologist, with
more apparent reason perhaps, has
founded an argument for an extensive
emigration of the Highlanders on the
prevalence of the primitive rocks in
the north and west of Scotland. It
is only from a complete and systematic
survey that we can venture to
predicate anything with certainty of
the future agricultural powers of a
country; and, in the absence of such
trustworthy data, we must be content
to estimate the future wheat-productiveness
of Michigan, as well as
of the other States we have named
along with it, from what we know of
their present fertility, and of the vast
extent that is still uncleared.</p>

<p>As to New York and the other old-settled
States of the Union, which we
are told do not now produce enough
for their own consumption, are we to
take it for granted that they are always
to continue stationary, and to
make no effort to keep pace with the
growing demands of an increasing
population? Professor Johnston, we
observe in one passage, has qualified
his opinion as to the prospective dearth
of grain by this curious condition&mdash;"<em>Provided
no change takes place in
their agricultural system.</em>" But what
shadow of a reason can be given for
supposing it will not take place? The
area of New York State is only one-twelfth
less than that of England, and
is, at least, no way inferior as to climate
or quality of soil. As far as
material means go, it is quite capable
of maintaining, under an improved
culture, at least four times its present
population of three millions.
The only question is as to the will
and ability of her people to develop
these means; and on this point Professor
Johnston's own work is full
of multiplied proofs of the zealous
and intelligent spirit of improvement
which is extending rapidly all over
the North-Eastern States. We find
the central government of the Confederation
occupied in organising the
plan of an Agricultural Bureau on a
scale worthy of a great and enlightened
nation&mdash;a work that contrasts
in a very marked way with the
studious neglect which such subjects
meet with from the government of
this country.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We find the several
State legislatures anxiously encouraging
every species of improvement&mdash;that
of New York, in particular,
devoting large grants to the
support of exhibitions; preparing to
found an Agricultural College; distributing
widely and gratuitously the
annual public reports on the state
of agriculture; and, finally, sending
to Europe for a celebrated chemist
to assist in maturing their plans, and
sitting&mdash;senators and great officers of
state&mdash;at the feet of a British Gamaliel,
laying down the law to them on
the true principles of the all-important
science of agriculture. Nor are
the owners of the land asleep. It is
a strong indication of their growing
desire for information, that seven or
eight agricultural periodicals are published
in the State of New York alone.
Professor Johnston found no less than
fifty copies of such papers taken regularly
in a small town in Connecticut
of some two thousand inhabitants;
and he had occasion to observe, in
his intercourse with the farmers of
New York, their general acquaintance
with the geology of their country, and
its relation to the management of
their lands. Their implement-makers,
who had already taught us the use
of the horse-rake, the cradle-scythe,
and the improved churn, have
recently outstripped us by the invention,
or at least the great improvement,
of the reaping-machine, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
advantages of which are so appreciated
in the country of its origin
that at Chicago 1500 of M'Cormick's
machines were ordered in one year.
In short, the proverbial energy, perseverance,
and sagacity that distinguish
our Yankee friends, seem now
to be all directed towards effecting a
change of system in the management
of land; and the true question is, not
whether the hitherto laggard progress
of American agriculture is to be quickened
in future, but whether we shall
be able to keep pace with it.</p>

<p>But then Professor Johnston tells
us that improvement is expensive, and
that every process for reviving the
dormant powers of the soil, and preserving
their activity, must necessarily
be attended with an addition to the
price of the produce, which will thus
prevent its coming into competition
with that of England. This view rests
upon a fallacy, which we are sure the
author must have drawn from his reading
in political economy, and not from
his experience as an agriculturist. It is
an off-shoot from the rent-theory, (the
pestilent root of so much error and
confusion,) which, however, we shall
not notice at present, further than by
affirming, in direct contradiction to it,
that improvements do <em>not</em> necessarily,
nor generally, involve an increase of
price. Even those which require the
greatest outlay&mdash;even a complete system
of arterial drainage all over the
State of New York, instead of adding
to the cost of wheat, may very probably
reduce it, as it has certainly done
in this country. But most of the improvements
readily available in the
Eastern States involve scarcely any
expenditure at all. The most obvious
and effectual is to save and apply
the manure, which is now wasted or
thrown away; and when that proves
insufficient, abundant supplies of
mineral manures are easily procurable.
On the exhausted wheat-lands
of Virginia, a single dressing of lime
or marl generally doubles the first
crop. Deposits of gypsum, and of
the valuable mineral phosphate of
lime, seem to be abundant both in
New York and New Jersey. Again,
in the former State, where the common
practice is to plough to a depth
of <em>not more than four inches</em>, the simple
expedient of putting in the plough
a few inches deeper would of itself
add one-half to the return of wheat
over a very large district.</p>

<p>On the whole, so far from seeing any
reason to anticipate, with Professor
Johnston, a material reduction in the
quantity of our wheat imports from
the States, we look rather to see it
increased; and, at all events, we have
no hesitation in saying, that to encourage
our English farmers to expect
a cessation of competition from that
quarter is to deceive them with very
groundless hopes.</p>

<p>We have already dwelt at considerable
length on this topic, both because
of the prominent place it occupies
in Professor Johnston's volumes, and
of the notice which his speculations
upon it have attracted in this country.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that a large
proportion&mdash;probably not less than
one-half&mdash;of the cereal food consumed
in the States consists of maize and
buckwheat. Mr Johnston always
alludes to this fact, as if the use of
these grains were a matter of compulsion&mdash;as
if the Americans resorted
to them from being unable to afford
wheaten bread. Now, according to
the information we have from other
sources, the truth is just the reverse
of this. We are told that in the
Eastern and Central States, as well
as on the West frontier and among
the slave population, the various preparations
of Indian corn are becoming
more relished every year; and
that the extension of its cultivation
is to be attributed, not to the failure
of the wheat crops, but to a growing
preference for it as an article of food.
In a less degree the use both of oats
and buckwheat seems to be spreading
in the States, as well as in our
own colonies of New Brunswick and
Canada East; and one can scarcely
wonder at the taste for the latter
grain, after reading the appetising
descriptions our author gives of the
crisp hot cakes, with their savoury
adjuncts of maple-honey, which so
often formed his breakfast during his
wanderings. The general use of these
three kinds of grain&mdash;maize, oats, and
buckwheat&mdash;has somehow come to be
considered by political economists as
indicative of a low degree of social
advancement. And yet we know that,
in the countries suited to their growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
a given area of ground cultivated with
any of them will return a greater
quantity of nutritious food, at a smaller
expense and with less risk of failure,
than if it were cropped with wheat.
We are told that the great objection to
them is, that their culture <em>is too easy</em>.
Professor Johnston touches upon this
notion in some remarks he makes on
the disadvantage of buckwheat as a
staple article of food. The objections
to it, he tells us, consist in the ease
with which it can be raised, the rapidity
of its growth, and the small quantity
of seed it requires: it induces, he says,
like the potato, an indolent, slovenly,
and exhausting culture; and "it is
the prelude of evil, when a kind of
food that requires little exertion to
obtain it becomes the staple support
of a people."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It may be noticed in
passing, that, in point of fact, the
results alleged are at least not universal;
for, in regard to this very
grain, we find its cultivation prevalent
in some of the best-managed districts
of the hard-working, provident,
and intelligent Belgians. But taking
the axiom as it stands, we cannot
help suspecting that there is some
fallacy lurking at the bottom of it.
Misled by what we have observed of
the Irishman and his potato diet, we
have confounded the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum hoc</i> with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter hoc</i>, and come to regard
an easily-raised food as <em>the cause</em> of
that indolence of which it is only the
frequent indication. It were otherwise
a most inexplicable contrariety
between the physical and the moral
laws which govern this world, that
in every country there should be a
penalty of social wretchedness and
degradation attached to the use of
that particular food which its climate
and soil are best suited to produce.
Can it be supposed that the blessings
of nature are only a moral snare for
us, and that, while she has given to
the American the maize plant&mdash;oats
to the Scotch Highlander&mdash;rice to
the Hindoo&mdash;the banana to the inhabitant
of Brazil&mdash;a regard for their
social well-being requires each of
them to renounce these gifts, and to
spend their labour in extorting from
the unwilling soil some less congenial
kind of subsistence? Virgil has
warned the husbandman&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">But it were surely a dire aggravation
of the difficulties of his task if his
most plentiful harvest were also the
most injurious to his advancement
and true happiness. We cannot
now, however, examine the grounds
of a doctrine so paradoxical, and
have adverted to it only to remark
that it seems destined to meet with a
most direct practical refutation in
North America, where we find the
habitual use of what we choose to
consider the coarser grains associated
with the highest intelligence and the
most rapid development of social
progress. There can be no doubt
that the nature of the food generally
used in any nation must exert an important
influence on its prosperity;
but it is difficult to understand how
that prosperity should be promoted
by the universal use of that variety
which costs most labour. At all
events, it is certainly a subject of
very interesting inquiry, in reference
to the increasing consumption among
ourselves of wheat&mdash;the dearest and
most precarious species of grain,
much of it imported from other countries&mdash;and
its gradual abandonment
in North America, what effect these
opposite courses may have on the
future destinies of the two great
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>Leaving this as a problem for political
economists, let us now follow
him in his visit to the British side
of the St Lawrence. His brief three
weeks' survey of the Canadas did
not, of course, enable him to form
any very intimate acquaintance with
the condition of these provinces;
and he prudently abstains from pronouncing
any judgment upon the
vexed topics of Canadian politics.
His presence at the great exhibition,
at Kingston, of the Agricultural Society
of Upper Canada, gave him a
good opportunity of estimating the
progress that has been made in practical
agriculture. The stock, as well
as the implements, there brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
forward in competition for the various
premiums, amounting in all to £1000,
gave most satisfactory indications of
improvement; while the large attendance,
and the interest taken in the
proceedings, sufficiently showed that
the inhabitants of the Upper Province
are now awake to the necessity of
agricultural improvement as the main
source of their future prosperity. In
a country where eighty per cent of
the whole population are directly engaged
in the cultivation of the soil,
the land interest is, or ought to be,
predominant. But the bitter animosity
of political parties, and the abortive
attempts of government to soothe
and reconcile them, have hitherto
stood much in the way of any combined
effort towards the encouragement
of improved cultivation. The
art of husbandry is not likely to thrive
in a country where every man is bent
on proving himself a Cincinnatus.
Of late, however, public spirit has
shown symptoms of taking a more
wholesome direction; and, notwithstanding
occasional ministerial crises
and political explosions, which we on
this side the water are sometimes
puzzled to understand, all parties in
the province seem now fully aware
that the development of the vast
resources of their fertile soil is the
only road to permanent prosperity.
The encouragement of local competitions,
the provision for systematic instruction
in agriculture in the colleges&mdash;which
Professor Johnston tells us is
in progress&mdash;and the introduction of
elementary lessons in the art as a regular
branch of common school learning,
are all steps in the right direction.
It is precisely in such a community as
that of Canada that the last-mentioned
kind of instruction is really of
essential benefit. From the last
census of Upper Canada, it appears
that there are sixty thousand owners
of land in the province, and only ten
thousand labourers without land.
The great majority of the boys in
the ordinary schools will become proprietors,
and, at the same time, cultivators;
and, in such circumstances,
it is of the utmost importance that
the youth should acquire betimes a
competent knowledge of the principles
on which his future practice is,
or ought to be, founded&mdash;such knowledge
as will, at least, enable him to,
shake off the traditional prejudices
and slovenly habits which his father
may have imported with him from
Harris or the County Kerry.</p>

<p>The querulous and depreciatory
tone which our Canadian fellow-subjects
are apt to employ in speaking of
their country, and its prospects, is
remarked by Professor Johnston as
contrasting oddly with the unqualified
adulation of everything&mdash;from
the national constitution to the navy
button&mdash;which one constantly hears
from his republican neighbour. One
consequence of this habit is, the
existence of a prevalent but very
mistaken notion that, in the march of
social advancement, Canada has been
completely distanced by the United
States. Professor Johnston has been
at some pains to demonstrate, and we
think most successfully, that this impression
is entirely erroneous. Indeed,
if we only recollect the history
of Canada for the last fifteen years&mdash;the
disunion of her own people, and
the reckless commercial experiments
to which she has been subjected by
the home government, the rapid strides
in improvement&mdash;of the Upper Province
especially&mdash;are almost marvellous.
As a corroboration of what Professor
Johnston has said on the subject,
we have thrown together in the
subjoined table, collected from the
Government returns, some of the
most striking and decisive evidences
of the recent progress of Upper
Canada. In certain particulars, no
doubt, she is outstripped by some of
those districts of the States to which
from time to time extraordinary
migrations of their unsettled and
nomadic population have been directed.
But putting such exceptional
cases out of view, the inhabitants of
Canada need fear no comparison
with the Union in all the chief elements
of national advancement.</p>

<p>In looking at the great sources of
wealth possessed by these provinces,
our attention is at once arrested by
the growing importance of the St
Lawrence as an outlet to the produce,
not only of the Canadas, but of a vast
area of the States territory. With
the exception, perhaps, of the Mississippi,
no river in the world opens up
so grand a highway for the industry
of man as the St Lawrence, with the
chain of vast lakes and innumerable
rivers that unite with it in the two
thousand miles of its majestic progress
to the ocean. Never was there an
enterprise more worthy of a great
nation than that of surmounting the
obstacles to its navigation, and completing
the channels of connection
with its tributary waters; and nobly
have the people of Canada executed
it. Taking into account the infancy
of their country, and the amount of its
population and revenue, it is not too
much to say, with Mr Johnston, that
their exertions to secure water-communication
have been greater than
those of any part of the Union, or
any country of Europe. The improvements
on the St Lawrence itself,
and the canals connected with it,
have already cost the colony two millions
and a quarter sterling, in addition
to the expenditure of £800,000
by the home government on the construction
of the Rideau Canal. The
results of this liberal but judicious
outlay are already showing themselves,
not only by the rapidly-increasing
Canadian traffic on the St Lawrence,
but by its drawing into it, year after
year, a larger share of the commerce
of the States. That the influx of
trade from the south must ere long
vastly exceed its present amount, is
evident from a consideration of the
gigantic projects already completed,
or in course of construction, for effecting
an access between the lakes and
the fertile regions of Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois, &amp;c., already spoken of,
and thus saving the longer and costlier
transit by the Mississippi. One
of the Reports of the State of New
York thus speaks of them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three great canals, (one of them
longer than the Erie Canal,) embracing
in their aggregate length about one thousand
miles, are to connect the Ohio with
Lake Erie; while another deep and capacious
channel, excavated for nearly thirty
miles through solid rock, unites Lake
Michigan with the navigable waters of
the Illinois. In addition to these broad
avenues of trade, they are constructing
lines of railroads not less than fifteen
hundred miles in extent, in order to reach
with more case and speed the lakes
through which they seek a conveyance to
the seaboard. The circumstance, moreover,
is particularly important, that the
public works of each of these great communities
are arranged on a harmonious
plan, each having a main line, supported
and enriched by lateral and tributary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
branches, thereby bringing the industry
of their people into prompt and profitable
action; while the systems themselves are
again united, on a grander scale, with
Lake Erie as its common centre."</p></blockquote>

<p>The various streams of the trade
from the interior being thus collected
in the lakes&mdash;which form, as it were,
the heart of the system&mdash;there are
two great channels for its redistribution
and dispersion through the markets
of the world. These are the St
Lawrence, and the Erie Canal with
the Hudson; and the vital question
as regards the prosperity of Canada
is, by which of these outlets will the
concentrated traffic of the lakes find
its way to the ocean? Mr Johnston
has devoted considerable attention to
this subject, and assigns two good
reasons for believing that the St
Lawrence is destined immensely to
increase the share which it has already
secured. In the first place, the
American artery is already surcharged
and choked up;&mdash;notwithstanding
all the efforts that have
been made to expedite the traffic on
the Erie Canal, it has been found
wholly inadequate to accommodate
the immense trade pouring in from
the west; and, secondly, the route
of the St Lawrence, besides being
the more expeditious, is now found
to be the cheaper one. In a document
issued by the Executive Council
of Upper Canada, it is mentioned
that the Great Ohio Railway Company,
having occasion to import about
11,000 tons of railway iron from
England, made special inquiries as to
the relative cost of transport by the
St Lawrence and New York routes,
the result of which was the preference
of the former, the saving on the inland
transport alone being 11,000
dollars. There seems good reason to
expect that a considerable portion of
the Mississippi trade may be diverted
into the Canadian channel; but putting
this out of view altogether, it is
certain that the navigation of this
glorious river is every year becoming
of greater importance to the United
States, as well as to Britain: let us
hope that it is destined ever to bear
on its broad breast the blessings of
peace and mutual prosperity to both
nations.</p>

<p>After a rapid glance at Lower
Canada, Professor Johnston crossed
the St Lawrence, in order to complete
the survey of New Brunswick, which,
before leaving England, he had been
commissioned to make for the Government
of the colony. We have had
no opportunity of seeing the official
Report, in which he has published
the detailed results of his observations;
but the valuable information
collected in these volumes has strongly
confirmed our previous impression,
that the resources and importance of
this fine colony have never yet been
sufficiently appreciated at home.
With an area as nearly as possible
equal to that of Scotland, it possesses
a much larger surface available for
agriculture. The climate is healthy
and invigorating; it is traversed by
numerous navigable rivers; its rocks
contain considerable mineral wealth;
and the fisheries on its coasts are inexhaustible.
Imperfectly developed
as its resources are, the trade from
the two ports of St John's and St
Andrew's alone, exceeds that of the
whole of the three adjoining States of
the Union&mdash;Maine, Vermont, and
New Hampshire&mdash;although its inhabitants
do not number one-sixth of the
population of these States. As to the
fertility of the soil, Professor Johnston,
by a comparison of authentic returns,
shows that the productive power of
the land already cultivated in the
province considerably exceeds the
averages of New York, of Ohio, and
of Upper Canada&mdash;countries which
have hitherto been considered more
favoured both in soil and climate.
By classifying the soils in the several
districts, he has estimated that the
available land, after deducting a reserve
for fuel, is capable of maintaining in
abundance a population of 4,200,000;
while its present number little exceeds
200,000. In all the course of his
travels, he met with but a few
rare instances in which the agricultural
settlers did not express their
contentment with their circumstances;
and although it seems still questionable
whether farming on a large
scale, by the employment of hired
labour, can be made remunerative,
the universal opinion of the experienced
persons he consulted testified
that, with ordinary prudence and industry,
the poorest settler, who confines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
his attention to the clearing and cultivation
of land, is sure of attaining a
comfortable independence.</p>

<p>The question naturally occurs&mdash;How
is it that, with all these natural
advantages and encouragements to colonisation,
and with its proximity to
our shores, so very small a proportion&mdash;not
more than one in sixty or seventy
of the emigrants from Great Britain&mdash;make
New Brunswick their destination?
Professor Johnston, while he
maintains that, taking population into
account, New Brunswick is in this
respect no worse off than Canada,
adverts to several causes of a special
nature which may have retarded its
settlement. But the truth is, that
the question above started leads us
directly to another of far greater compass
and importance&mdash;What is the
reason that all our colonies taken
together absorb so small a proportion
of our emigrants compared with the
United States? What is the nature
of the inducements that annually
impel so large a number of our countrymen
to forfeit the character of British
subjects, and prefer a domicile
among those who are aliens in laws,
interests, and system of government?</p>

<p>We hardly know how to venture
upon anything connected with the
ominous subject of emigration, at a
moment when the crowds leaving our
shores, at the rate of nearly a thousand
every day, are such as to startle
the most apathetic observer, and
shake the faith of the most dogmatic
economist in the truth of his speculations.
This is not the place to inquire
what strangely compulsive cause
it may be that has all at once swelled
the ordinary stream of emigration
into a headlong torrent.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Mayhap it
is neither distant, nor doubtful, nor
unforetold. But whatever it may be,
there stands the fact&mdash;which we can
neither undo, nor, for aught that can
be seen at present, prevent its annual
recurrence in future, or say how and
when the waves are to be stayed.
"When the Exe runs up the streets
of Tiverton," says a certain noble
prophet&mdash;whose vaticinations, however,
have not been very felicitous
hitherto&mdash;"then, and not till then,
may we expect to see the reversal of
the free-import system;" and then,
and not till then, we take leave to
add, may we hope to see the ebbing
of that tide of British capital and
British strength which is now flowing
strongly and steadily into the bay
of New York.</p>

<p>The accompanying abstract, from
the returns of the Emigration Commissioners,
exhibits two most remarkable
results:&mdash;1st, The proportion of
emigration to British America and
other destinations is gradually falling
off; 2d, That to the United States is
steadily and rapidly increasing, so
that they now receive four out of
every five emigrants who leave our
shores. Is this distribution to be
regarded as a matter of indifference
in a political point of view? Are we
to understand that it is no concern to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
us who remain behind, whether the
labour and capital of those who leave
us shall go to fill up the vacuum of
our own colonial empire, or to carry
new accessions of wealth and power
to those in whose prosperity (to put
the matter mildly) we have only a
secondary interest? This question
the consistent Free-Trader is bound
to answer unhesitatingly in the affirmative.
In his cosmopolitan philosophy,
the interests of one country
are no more to be considered than
those of any other. The theory of
absolute freedom of exchange expunges
altogether the idea of nationalism,
and regards man, not as a
member of this or that community,
but as the denizen of a great universal
republic. Local and historical
associations&mdash;ties of kindred and of
birth&mdash;are only so many obstructions
in the way of human progress; and
an Englishman is nothing more than
the subject of certain animal wants
and instincts, the gratification of
which he must be left to seek wherever
he finds the materials most
abundant. Such is Free Trade in its
true scope and ultimate tendency.
What shall be said, then, of the consistency
or sincerity of those pseudo-apostles
of the doctrine, who, having
been the most active in promoting
that nibbling and piecemeal legislation
which they choose to call freedom
of trade&mdash;who have been loudest
in proclaiming a universal commercial
fraternity, and in denouncing
colonies as a wasteful encumbrance&mdash;are
now the first to take alarm at the
natural and inevitable result of their
own measures, and to call out for a
better regulation of emigration; in
other words, for legislative interference
with the free action of those
of our countrymen who, being thrust
out of employment in the land of their
birth, are so literally following out
the great maxim of buying in the
cheapest market and selling in the
dearest?</p>

<p>The text is a tempting one, but we
must refrain from wandering further
from the subject with which we started&mdash;namely,
the inducements which lead so many
of our emigrants to
select the United States as their
future home. One of the prevalent
causes has been very well stated by
Professor Johnston&mdash;that which we
may call the capillary attraction of
former emigration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A letter from a connection or acquaintance
determines the choice of a
place to go to, and, without further inquiry,
the emigrant starts. Thus for a
while, emigration to a given point, once
begun, goes on progressively by a sort of
innate force. Those who go before urge
those who follow by hasty and inaccurate
representations; so that, the more
numerous the settlers from a particular
district, the more numerous also the invitations
for others to follow, till the
fever of emigration subsides. In other
words, in proportion as the home-born
settlers in one of these countries increases,
will the number of home-born emigrants
to that country increase&mdash;<em>but for a time
only, if the place have real disadvantages</em>."&mdash;(Vol.
ii, p. 204.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It is vain to shut our eyes to the
fact that the government of the
United States offers to the emigrant
many real, substantial, and peculiar
advantages. The first and most important
aid that can be given to the
intending settler is a complete and
accurate survey of the country; and
this has been accomplished by the
States government at great expense,
but in so perfect a manner that a
purchaser has no difficulty in at once
pointing out, on the official plan, any
lot he may have selected in the most
remote corner of the wilderness. The
next point of importance to him is
simplicity of conveyance and security
of title; and so effectual and satisfactory
is the American system that
litigation in original land-titles is
almost unknown. Then as to the
weighty consideration of price&mdash;which
perhaps ought to have been
first mentioned&mdash;the uniform and
very low rate in the States of 5s. 3d.
an acre saves infinite trouble, disputation,
and jealousy. Such are some
of the temptations held out to the
intending purchaser of land; and it
must be confessed that, in each particular,
they present a striking contrast
to the difficulties he has to meet in
some of the British colonies&mdash;the
arbitrary changes of system, the
vexatious delays, and the comparatively
exorbitant charges&mdash;which
must appear to the settler as if they
had been contrived on purpose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
discourage him. When we add to
these the prospects of ready employment
in the States held out to other
classes of emigrants, and the stringent
laws lately made for their protection,
both on the passage and on
their arrival, we cannot be at a loss
to see that the direction which emigration
has lately taken is not the
result of chance or caprice, but of a
deliberate comparison of advantages,
which the most ignorant can easily
understand and appreciate.</p>

<p>The main object of Professor Johnston's
visit being of a scientific character,
his remarks on the general topics of
manners and politics occur only incidentally;
but it is impossible for any
traveller to keep clear of such subjects
in writing of a country, the
peculiarities of which are pressed
upon his notice at every hour of the
day, and at every corner of the
street. Rabelais tells us of a certain
island, explored by the mighty Pantagruel,
whose inhabitants lived wholly
upon <em>wind</em>&mdash;that is, being interpreted,
on flattery; and the visitor of the
States who finds himself, as it were,
pinned to the wall, and compelled to
yield up his admiration at discretion,
may be sometimes tempted to believe
that he has made a similar discovery,
and that the flatulent diet of
compliment is somehow congenial to an
American appetite. Professor Johnston
seems to have had his candour or
his eulogistic powers sometimes severely
tested, if we may guess from his
quiet hint, that "it is unpleasant to
a stranger to be always called on to
admire and praise what he sees in a
foreign country; and it is a part of
the perversity of human nature to
withhold, upon urgent request, what,
if unasked, would have been freely
and spontaneously given." He is of
course prepared for the reception
which any work, aiming at mere
impartiality, is sure to meet with
among Transatlantic critics; and it
will, therefore, not surprise him to
find that the above peccant sentence
has been already pounced upon by
them as proving <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malice prepense</i>, and
as affording a significant key to all
his observations on the institutions
of the States.</p>

<p>The following extract explains the
origin of two of those euphonious
party designations in which our
neighbours delight, and which may
perchance have puzzled some of our
readers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In England, to be a <em>democrat</em> still
implies a position at the very front of
the movement party, and a desire to
hasten forward political changes, irrespective
of season or expediency. But
among the American democrats there is
a Conservative and a Radical party.
The former, who desire to restrain
'the amazing violence of the popular
spirit,' are nicknamed by their democratic
adversaries the '<em>Old Hunkers</em>;'
the latter, who profess to have in their
hearts 'sworn eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny over the mind of
man,' are stigmatised as '<em>Barnburners</em>.'
The <cite>New York Tribune</cite>, in reference to
the origin of the names themselves, says
that the name 'Hunkers' was intended
to indicate that those on whom it was
conferred had an appetite for a large
'hunk' of the spoils; though we never
could discover that they were peculiar
in <em>that</em>. On the other hand, the 'Barnburners'
were so named in allusion to
the story of an old Dutchman who relieved
himself of rats by burning his
barns, which they infested, just like exterminating
all banks and corporations,
to root out the abuses connected therewith."&mdash;(Vol.
i. p. 218.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Equally mysterious is the term
"log-rolling," though the thing itself
is not altogether unknown in legislatures
nearer home.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the trees are felled and trimmed,
rolling the logs to the rivers or
streams down which they are to be
floated, as soon as the spring freshets set
in, remains to be done. This being the
hardest work of all, the men of several
camps will unite, giving their conjoined
strength to the first party on Monday,
to the second on Tuesday, and so on. A
like system in parliamentary matters is
called 'log-rolling.' You and your
friends help me in my railroad bill, and I
and my friends help you with your bank
charter; or sometimes the Whigs and
Democrats, when nearly balanced, will
get up a party log-rolling, agreeing that
the one shall be allowed to carry through
a certain measure without much opposition,
provided a similar concession is
granted to the other."&mdash;(Vol. ii. p. 297.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Notes</cite> convey to us the strong
impression that Professor Johnston's
visit to the West has operated
as a wholesome corrective of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
certain tendency in his political
opinions. He seems to have
left home with a warm admiration
of American institutions generally,
which, like Slender's love, "it pleased
heaven to diminish on further acquaintance."
At all events, he could
not avoid being struck with some of
the many perplexities and anomalies
that result from referring everything
directly to the popular voice. In
England, whatever dissensions may
arise about the enactment of law, all
are agreed in a sensitive jealousy as to
the purity of its administration. The
most rampant Radical among us looks
upon justice as far too sacred a thing
to be hazarded in the rude chance-medley
of popular election. The
keenest partisan feels that, in the lofty
and unswerving integrity of our
judges, he possesses a substantial
security and blessing, for the loss of
which no place, power, or parliamentary
triumph, could compensate.
To one accustomed to regard with
veneration the dignified independence
of the judicial office in Great Britain,
nothing will appear more harshly repugnant
to sound policy than the
system, lately introduced into some of
the New England States, of appointing
all judges, high and low, by the
votes of the electors of the district
over which they are to preside, and
for a limited term of years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was deservedly considered a great
triumph when the appointment of judges
for life liberated the English bench from
the influence of the Crown, and when
public opinion became strong enough to
enforce the selection of the most learned
in the law for the highest judicial offices.
Now, passing over the objection which
some will strongly urge, that the popular
electors are not the best judges of the
qualifications of those who aspire to the
bench, and that the most popular legal
demagogue may expect to obtain from
them the highest legal appointment, it
may be reasonably asked whether popular
influence in seasons of excitement,
and on questions of great moment, may
not bias the minds of judges whose appointment
is in the hands of the people?&mdash;whether
the fear of a coming election
may not deter them from unpopular decisions?
The influence of a popular majority
may here as profoundly pollute the
fountains of justice as the influence of the
Crown ever did among us at home."&mdash;(Vol.
i. p. 150.)</p></blockquote>

<p>At first sight, it seems quite unaccountable
that an enlightened people
should ever have devised or sanctioned
a system which so obviously exposes
the bench to the risk of corruption;
and one is at a loss to reconcile a
reverence for the law with an ordinance
that subjects her minister to
the ordeal of canvassing and cajoling
all and sundry&mdash;perhaps the very
men who may next day be in the
dock before him. But the root of the
anomaly is not hard to find. Into
the purest of republics ambition and
cupidity&mdash;the love of office and the
love of dollars&mdash;will force their way.
But then, under that form of constition,
situations of trust and emolument
are necessarily few in comparison
to the number of candidates for
them. The offices in the civil departments
of the United States governments
are not numerous. The navy
employs altogether some five hundred
officers above the rank of midshipman&mdash;exactly
the number of our post-captains;
and the whole army of the
Confederation, rank and file, musicians
and artificers included, is very
little over ten thousand men. There
is little temptation to enter the medical
profession, in which learning and
experience go for nothing, and a
Brodie is precisely on a level with
a "Doctor Bokanky;"&mdash;nor the
Church, in which the pastor is hired
by the twelvemonth, and is thought
handsomely paid with a wage of £100
a-year. What field, then, remains
for the aspiring spirit but the law?&mdash;and
what wonder if the sixteen thousand
attorneys, who, we are told,
find a living in the States, and take a
leading part in the management of
all public business, should vote "the
higher honours of the profession" far
too few to be retained as perpetual
incumbencies? Hence has sprung
the device of popular election to, and
rotation in, the sweets of office,
which, by "passing it round," and
giving everyone a chance, is designed
to render it as generally available as
possible. The constitution of the
judiciary is not uniform, but varies in
almost every different state. In New
York, the Judges of Appeals, as well
as those of the Supreme and Circuit
Courts, are elected by the people
at large, and for a term of eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
years, each leaving office in rotation.
In New Jersey they are
appointed for six years by the governor
and senate; in Vermont, annually
by the legislature. In Connecticut
nearly the same system prevails
as that in Vermont; while in
Massachusetts the judges retain office
"during good behaviour." The salaries
are not less various, in some
States the remuneration of judges of
supreme courts being £500 a-year,
which is about the highest rate; and
in others so low as £180. There are
no retiring allowances in any case;
and as they are thus liable to be
thrown out of office at an uncertain
period, or compelled to vacate it
after a short term of years, it can
scarcely be expected that such remuneration
will secure the highest grade
of legal acquirements, either for the
bench itself, or for the inferior offices
of attorney-generalships and chief-clerkships,
which are all held by the
same lax tenure of popular favour.
Even if the system has "worked
well," as it is said to have done by
American writers, during the four or
five years it has been in operation in
New York&mdash;even if it be true that
the lawyers of the Empire State have,
by avoiding the snares thrown in
their way, given proof individually of
the probity of Cato, and of a constancy
worthy of Socrates, we still
say that the State does wrong in putting
their virtues to such a test. Mr
Johnston supplies us with an example
of the temptation it holds out to a
dangerous pliancy of principle. Most
of our readers must be aware of the
existence of an active and noisy party
in the States, who, under the name of
"Anti-renters," are seeking to free
themselves from payment of certain
reserved <em>rents</em>, or <i>feu-duties</i>, as they
would be termed in Scotland, which
form the stipulated condition of land
tenure in a certain district.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The question has caused much excitement
and considerable disturbance in
the State. It has been agitated in the
legislature and in the courts of law, and
the supposed opinion in regard to it of
candidates for legal appointments, is said
to have formed an element which weighed
with many in determining which candidate
they would support. During the
last canvass for the office of attorney-general,
I met with the following advertisement
in the public journals of the
State:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I have repeatedly been applied to
by individuals to know my opinions with
regard to the manorial titles, and what
course I intend to pursue, if elected, in
relation to suits commenced, and to be
commenced, under the joint resolution of
the Senate and Assembly. I have uniformly
replied to these inquiries, that I
regard the manor titles as a public curse
which ought not to exist in a free government,
and that if they can be broken up
and invalidated by law, it will give me
great pleasure; and I shall prosecute the
pending suits with as much vigour and
industry as I possess, and will commence
others, if, on examination, I shall be satisfied
there is the least chance of success.
I regard these prosecutions as a
matter of public duty, and, in this instance,
duty squares with my inclination
and wishes.</p>

<p class="sig">'L. S. CHATFIELD.'</p>

<p>"Mr Chatfield," adds Professor Johnston,
"<em>is now attorney-general</em>; and I was
informed that the known opinions of certain
of the old judges on this exciting
question was one of the understood reasons
why they were not re-elected by
popular suffrage, when, according to the
new constitution, their term of office had
expired."&mdash;(Vol. ii. p. 291.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, we see the highest law
officer of the State openly "bidding"
for office&mdash;truckling to faction&mdash;and
indecently condescending to enact the
part of a "soft-sawderer." That
term, we presume, is the proper American
equivalent for the stinging <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soubriquet</i>
with which Persius stigmatises
some Chatfield&mdash;some supple
attorney-general of his day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Cretata ambitio."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When persons of the highest official
position scruple not thus undisguisedly
to trim their course according
to the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popularis aura</i>," one
can scarcely help suspecting a want
of firmness of principle and genuine
independence among the classes below
them. De Tocqueville's observations
have taught us to doubt
whether the tree of liberty that grows
under the shadow of a tyrant majority
can ever attain a healthy stability,
however vigorous it may appear externally.
No one questions that the
Americans enjoy, under their institutions,
very many of the blessings of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
liberal and cheaply-administered government.
You have perfect liberty
of speech and action, so far as the
government is concerned. The avowal
of one's opinion is not followed, as in
Italy, or in the rival republic of
France, by a hint that your passport
is ready, or by the polite attendance
on you, wherever you go, of a mysterious
gentleman in black; but you
feel yourself, nevertheless, perpetually
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en surveillance</i>," and constrained
either to sail with the stream, or to
adopt a reserve and reticence which,
to an Englishman, is almost as irksome
as the knowledge that there is a
spy sitting at the same dinner-table
with him.</p>

<p>The spirit of Professor Johnston's
strictures on such anomalies
will, of course, insure his being set
down by his democratic friends in
America as an unmitigated "old
hunker;" and he certainly shows no
great liking for practical republicanism.
But to find fault with our
neighbours' arrangements, and to be
contented with our own, are two very
different things; and, accordingly,
our author takes many opportunities,
as he goes along, of showing that he
is quite aware of the innumerable
rents in our own old battered tea-kettle
of a constitution, and of the
infinite tinkering it will take to make
it hold water.</p>

<p>We should have held him unworthy
of the character of a true Briton if he
had omitted the occasion of a grumble
at our system of taxation, though, of
course, we differ with him entirely in
the view he takes of the evil. After
an elaborate comparison of the taxation
in the United States with that of
Great Britain, he sums up all with
the following somewhat sententious
apophthegm:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great contrast between the two
sections of the Anglo-Saxon race on the
opposite sides of the Atlantic is this&mdash;<em>On
the one side the masses rule and property
pays; on the other side property
rules and the masses pay</em>."&mdash;(Vol. ii. 254.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The sentence sounds remarkably
terse and epigrammatic. Most of
such brilliant and highly-condensed
crystals of wisdom, however, will be
found on analysis to contain, along
with some exaggerated truth, a considerable
residuum of nonsense; and
this specimen before us, we apprehend,
forms no exception. Even if
the fact so broadly asserted were indisputable,
we should still be inclined
to doubt, after what the author has
himself told us, whether the "rule of
the masses" is always an unmixed
blessing to a community. He has
seen enough of it to know at least
that the preponderance of popular
sway is not incompatible with much
social restraint&mdash;with prejudice and
narrow-mindedness&mdash;with what <em>he</em>
considers a false commercial principle&mdash;with
a disregard of public faith,
and of the rights of other nations;
and lastly, with a contempt of the
rights of humanity itself, and a legalised
traffic in our fellow men. But, if
we understand him rightly, he does
not so much defend the abstract excellence
of the democratic principle
as advocate a nearer approach, on our
part, to the American model of taxation.
In the States, he says, property
pays&mdash;in England the masses pay;&mdash;that
is, if we strip the proposition of
its antithetical obscurity, the owners
of property pay less here than they
do in America&mdash;not only <em>absolutely</em>
less, but less in proportion to the
whole amount of taxation. The calculations
on which he founds this assertion
are too long and involved to
be quoted at length, but we will
endeavour to abridge them so as to
enable the reader to judge of their
accuracy.</p>

<p>The taxes in the United States are
of three classes: 1st,&mdash;the <em>national</em>
taxes, amounting to about six millions
a-year, which are raised chiefly by
customs duties on imports; 2d,&mdash;the
<em>state</em> taxes; 3d,&mdash;the <em>local</em> taxes, for
the service of the several counties,
cities, and townships. These two
last classes are levied chiefly in the
form of an equal rate assessed upon
the estimated value of all property,
real and personal.</p>

<p>In order to compare the incidence
of the public burdens upon property in
the two countries, Professor Johnston
selects the case of New York State,
in which the total taxable property
(personal as well as real) in 1849 was
666,000,000 of dollars, and the amount
of rates levied for state and local taxes
5,500,000 dollars, or about <sup><small>4</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub> per cent
on the gross valuation. Turning then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
to Great Britain, (excluding Ireland,)
he sets down the fee simple value of
the real property alone in estates
above £150 a-year, as rated to the
income-tax, at £2,382,000,000.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Four-fifths of a per cent (the rate
levied in New York) on this sum would
realise £19,000,000 sterling; and were
<em>all</em> property, real and <em>personal</em>, in this
island below £150 a-year, and the amount
of property in Ireland rated in a similar
way, and fairly collected, our entire revenue
of £50,000,000 would probably be
obtained as the revenue of the State of
New York now is, by this one property
tax only."&mdash;(Vol. ii. p. 257.)</p></blockquote>

<p>And he thus concludes that, as
regards the <em>absolute</em> amount of taxation,
property in Britain escapes for
a smaller payment than that in
America.</p>

<p>Now, it must be remarked, on this
branch of the comparison, that before
we can form any opinion as to its
soundness, it is essential that we
should know on what principles the
valuation of property is conducted
in New York. The whole question
depends upon this. If the system of
valuation is different in the two
countries, there are no materials
on which to build a conclusion. We
know what discrepancies may arise
out of the mode of valuation, from
the fact that, while the annual value
of <em>all</em> real property in England and
Wales was assessed for the poor-rate,
in 1841, at about £62,500,000,
<em>a portion</em> of it only&mdash;that over £150
a-year&mdash;was valued two years afterwards,
for the income-tax, at nearly
£86,000,000. We observe that Professor
Johnston has arrived at the
amount of real property in Britain, by
assuming the fee-simple value to be
twenty-seven years' purchase of the
income. But in New York, he tells
us, the value of income is calculated
at <em>only sixteen and a half years'</em>
purchase. The terms of the comparison
are, therefore, manifestly
faulty. And mark how this affects
the result. The real income of Great
Britain, capitalised at sixteen and a
half years' purchase, would amount
to only £1,447,000,000, and, if taxed
at the same rate as in New York,
would yield, instead of £19,000,000
only, £11,500,000, which, as it happens,
<em>is three millions less than it
actually pays</em>, as may be plainly seen
from the undernoted statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><em>Note.</em>&mdash;The first six items are taken from the Report of the House of Lords on
burdens affecting land, and some of them are below the present amounts.
The items affecting Scotland are obviously defective.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this extent at least, then, we are
justified in correcting Professor Johnston's
calculations, and in affirming
with certainty that the owner of
<em>real property in Britain surrenders
a larger portion of his wealth for
the public service than in New York</em>,
or any other State of the Union.
Whether the same can be said of
the British owner of <em>personal</em> property
is another question, which we
shall come to by-and-by.</p>

<p>So much for the <em>absolute</em> comparison.
But then Professor Johnston
aims also at proving, that while the
rich man is better off here, the poor
man is worse&mdash;that the "masses"
(<em>i. e.</em>, we presume, those who are
dependent on the wages of labour)
pay a larger share of the public
burdens than the same "masses"
do in America. And this, he thinks,
is demonstrated by the fact, that the
customs duties of America amount
to only a dollar a-head of the whole
population, whereas in Great Britain
they are <em>three</em> dollars&mdash;three times
heavier. Now, we venture to affirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
that, as a contrast between the position
of the labouring man on this
side of the Atlantic, and that of his
brother on the other, this statement
is quite a nest of fallacies. In the
first place, it proceeds on the assumption
(a very common but erroneous
one among our Free-Trade authorities)
that it is the labouring class
who pay the bulk of the taxes
drawn in the shape of customs. As
this error, however, may be held to
affect both sides of the comparison
equally, we have next to notice that,
admitting it to be the case, the fact
of the customs being three dollars
a-head in this country, and only
one in the States, only shows that
the English labourer pays <em>absolutely</em>
more than the Yankee, which no
one ever doubted. It amounts only
to this&mdash;that in an old country
which has to uphold numerous public
institutions unknown in America,
and with a public debt to provide for
of some £800,000,000 sterling, the
burden of this, as well as of all
other branches of taxation, is heavier
than in the youthful republic, with
a national debt of only £13,000,000.
In order to draw a fair parallel between
the cases as regards the
poorer classes of both countries,
we must put the question in a different
way, and inquire, what proportion
does the amount of customs
(assumed as representing the poor
man's share of taxation) bear <em>to the
whole public burdens</em> in the two
countries respectively? The contrasted
account would then show the
matter in a very different aspect from
that in which Professor Johnston has
represented it, and would stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Even if we were to throw into the scale
a large portion of the excise duties
levied in Britain, which Professor
Johnston may be entitled to claim as
a peculiar burden on "the masses"&mdash;at
least as much as the customs&mdash;it
would still be apparent, that, if such
payments are to be taken as a fair
criterion, <em>the people's burdens are not
relatively heavier here than in America</em>.
We shall only add further on this
subject, that while many of the less
opulent class of our fellow-citizens
have undoubted real grievances to
complain of, and while writers, with
worse intentions than Professor Johnston,
are ever ready to exaggerate
them, and to foster discontent, it becomes
one of his high character to
guard against allowing a somewhat
undisciplined taste for statistics to
betray him into rash general allegations,
calculated to produce error and
irritation.</p>

<p>The parallel he has drawn, however,
is very instructive on one point,
although he has failed to notice it.
He has taken some pains to prove
that, tried by the American standard,
our poor men pay too much, and our
owners of real property too little, in
both which conclusions we have
shown his grounds to be fallacious;
but he takes no notice of a far more
obvious anomaly, the glaring injustice
of which is every day attracting
more public comment&mdash;the comparative
<em>immunity of the owners of personal
property</em> in this country. The
local taxation of the States, it has
been seen, is levied by an equal assessment
on property <em>of all kinds</em>; and
although, from the character of a
great part of the country, the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
property much exceeds the movable
in amount, the rate upon both is a
uniform one. No description of possessions
is favoured with an invidious
exemption. We will take the assessment
of one State as an example, and
copy the following "Items of the
valuation of the taxable property for
the State of Iowa, according to the
assessor's returns for 1849." They
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Acres of land&mdash;Improvements on
land&mdash;Town lots and improvements&mdash;<em>Capital
employed in merchandise</em>&mdash;Mills,
manufactories, distilleries, carding machines
and tan-yards, <em>with the stock
employed</em>&mdash;Horses, cattle, sheep, &amp;c.&mdash;Pleasure
carriages, watches, pianofortes&mdash;<em>Capital
stocks and profits in any company
incorporated or unincorporated</em>&mdash;Property
in boats and vessels&mdash;Gold and
silver coin, and bank-notes in actual possession&mdash;<em>Claims
for money, or other consideration&mdash;Annuities&mdash;Amount
of notes,
mortgages, &amp;c. All other personal property
over 100 dollars.</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p>All these descriptions of property
contribute alike, dollar for dollar,
towards the expenses of the State,
which&mdash;be it remarked&mdash;embrace not
only the general charges for interest
of debt, and for the support of the
legislative, executive, and judiciary
departments, but include also payments
for prisons, asylums, the
militia, the public roads, and several
other branches of expenditure, which
in this country are saddled either
upon real property or upon the land
alone. Let any one look at the
items of the above list printed in
italics, and say what portion of such
wealth passes through the national
exchequer, or goes to uphold the
public institutions, of Great Britain.
The whole annual incomes above £50
a-year in Great Britain are estimated,
on the best attainable data,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to
amount to upwards of £352,000,000
sterling, of which the taxed real
income is £86,000,000, or one-fourth
part only. Is there any one with a
conscience so elastic as to maintain
that the owners of the other three-fourths
contribute fairly to the support
of the State, in proportion to the
revenue they enjoy under its protection?
From the investigations of Mr
Smee, to whom we have referred, it
appears that while the number of
those who pay the direct taxes is
about five hundred thousand, <em>there
are upwards of one million eight hundred
thousand persons in Great Britain
enjoying incomes of above £50 a-year,
who do not contribute one farthing to
them</em>. What is this but a system of
iniquitous exemption of the one class,
and of virtual confiscation as to the
other? But the whole subject occupies
far too prominent a place in the
public mind to be treated thus incidentally.
For the present then we
leave it, thoroughly persuaded that,
under a form of government which
acknowledges no distinctions between
classes and interests, so shameless a
violation of the plainest principles of
equity cannot long be permitted to
continue, and cordially joining in the
wish that no object of less momentous
interest&mdash;no schemes of impracticable
retrenchment&mdash;no wily bait of extended
suffrage&mdash;no flourishing of the
old red rag of reform, may be suffered
to distract the attention of the public,
from the one great paramount practical
reform&mdash;<span class="smcap">a readjustment of
Taxation</span>.</p>

<p>We owe an apology to Professor
Johnston for having deviated somewhat
from the ordinary course of a review.
His work has already been so
much and so flatteringly noticed, that
to have limited ourselves to mere abridgment
and quotation from the <em>Notes</em>
would have led us over the same
ground that has been already exhausted
by other critics. We have
therefore preferred discussing some of
the questions of greatest public interest
which his observations have suggested;
and if, on some of these, we
have been led to dissent from his
opinions, we have done so in no unfriendly
spirit, which indeed would
have been impossible in judging of an
author whose own views are always
expressed with perfect candour and
moderation. There can be no doubt
that, under the unpretending title
which he has chosen to adopt, he has
contrived to bring together a larger
mass of varied and valuable information
on the present condition of North
America than is to be found in any
work yet published.</p>

<h2>THE ANSAYRII.</h2>

<p><em>The Ansayrii (or Assassins;) with Travels in the Further East.</em> By the Hon.
<span class="smcap">Frederic Walpole</span>, R.N., Author of <cite>Four Years in the Pacific</cite>. London: Bentley,
1851.</p>


<p>Hail to the bright East, with all
its mysteries, its mighty past, its
pregnant future, its inexhaustible
sources of airiest amusement and
most solemn interest! We welcome
with pleasure the original and truly
Oriental book before us. It harmonises
rather with the poetic than
the historic character of Eastern lands;
but in its wild and dreamy narrative
there are to be found vivid and faithful
pictures, such as those that lighted
up the charmed reveries of DeQuincey.
For the present we will lay aside the
critic's task: we will postpone all
such considerations, and invite the
reader to accompany us in a rapid
tour over the varied regions which
Mr Walpole has recalled to our
memory and imagination. Let us
turn for a little from the "world
that is too much with us," and,
ranging away from chilly mists
and gloomy skies, sun our fancy
in the lands where Paradise was
planted.</p>

<p>Egypt and Palestine appear familiar
to us all; they are of common
interest to the whole Christian world&mdash;classic
lands to every old villager who
can read his Bible, as well as to the
profound scholar. In them, sacred
and profane history are so intimately
blended that the latter assumes
almost the authenticity of the former.
Herodotus and his followers have
actually a people still in the flesh (if
flesh the mummy may be called) to
refer to: subterranean Egypt is still
inhabited by the undecayed bodies of
the very men who associated with the
Israelites, and forms that were beautiful
and loved three thousand years
ago. Imperishable as their old inhabitants,
their temples and their monuments
still stand above them, and
will there remain unparalleled, until
their long-buried architects shall rise
again.</p>

<p>Passing on to Palestine, we find,
memories and associations still
stronger and more striking; for here
nature is invested with the sentiment
that in Egypt is awakened by art.
Palestine belongs not to time only,
but to eternity; with which, by types
and illustrations, its earthly history
is so beautifully blended and aggrandised.
Its literature is inspired truth,
its annals are prophecies fulfilled, and
the very face of the land itself vindicates
the beauty it <em>once</em> wore, through
all the sorrow and desolation that
have fallen on it since. Owing to
the metaphorical style of Oriental
composition, every object in nature
was used to illustrate or impress by
its analogy; and hence not only the
holy mountains, the sacred rivers,
and the battle plains have memories
for us, but the very "hyssop on the
wall," the blasted fig-tree, the cedar,
the "high rock in the thirsty land;"
every vale, and hill, and lake, and
city, is consecrated by some association
with the men who spoke the
words of God&mdash;with the time that
witnessed His presence in the
flesh.</p>

<p>The remorseless Jews were swept
from the Promised Land, as their
ancestor was from Eden, for the irreparable
sin; and the sword of the
Roman waved over the ruined walls
of Jerusalem, forbidding all return.
The Saracen and the Crusader succeeding,
add another element of interest&mdash;an
English association&mdash;to
long-tried and suffering Judea. The
Crusaders were rather a warlike emigration
than invasion; they were the
angry overflow of discontented Europe,
which sought to vent its spleen and
dogmas upon the Infidel. Their ebbing
tide bore back to us the arts and
sciences and chivalry of Arabia; and
thus Palestine became the channel for
all our best temporal acquirements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
as it had long since furnished us with
our eternal hope.</p>

<p>All this, and more&mdash;much more&mdash;invests
Syria with undying and exhaustless
interest to the student and
the traveller; but we will not linger
on such impressions now. We have
a lighter task to fulfil, though we are
about to visit the land of Nimrod,
of Abraham's nativity, and of the
empire of Semiramis. The pleasant
company in which we travel will
speed us on; and, in the old troubadour
fashion, lay and legend will
beguile the way. But before we enter
fairly on our pilgrimage to "Ur of
the Chaldees" and the tomb of
Nineveh, we shall pause to make some
practical observations on the route
which, in its present aspect, may be
new to some of our readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egypt may soon be reached in
ten days.</span><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This is almost incredible;
still more so, when we add that it
may be accomplished without fatigue,
hardship, or self-denial. The traveller
even now embarks at Southampton in
one of the Oriental Company's magnificent
steamers, and finds himself
landed at Alexandria in fifteen days,
having visited Gibraltar and Malta,
besides having travelled three thousand
miles in as much comfort as he would
have enjoyed at Brighton, with far
more advantage to his health and
spirits, and but trifling additional expense.
For our own parts, we believe
that, before long, sea voyages, instead
of sea shores, will be resorted to, not
only by the invalid, but by the epicurean
and the idler. The floating
hotels of our ocean steamers afford
as comfortable quarters as any of
their more stationary rivals, with the
additional advantage of presenting
a change of air and of scenery
every morning that the "lodger"
rises.</p>

<p>The autumn&mdash;the later the <em>better</em>&mdash;is
the <em>best</em> period for visiting Egypt.
October is, on the whole, the best
month for beginning the ascent of the
Nile. We will suppose the traveller
landed at Alexandria: he achieves
the lions of that suddenly-created
city (except Aboukir Bay) in a few
hours, and is ready to start for Cairo
in the mail steamer, with the India-bound
passengers who accompanied
him from England. The country in
which he now finds himself, by so
sudden a transition, is full of apparent
paradoxes; amongst others, he may be
surprised to find that the canal on
which he travels to Atfeh winds considerably,
though no engineering obstacles
whatever oppose themselves to
a straight course. The reason of this
sinuosity was thus explained to us by
Mehemet Ali himself:&mdash;"You ask why
my canal is not straight: Ya, Wallah!
it is owing to a bit of bigotry. The
dog who made it was a true Believer,
and something more. He said to
himself, 'Ya, Seedee, thou art about
to make what Giaours call a canal,
and Giaours in their impiety make
such things straight. Now, a canal
is made after the fashion of a river&mdash;(Allah
pardon us for imitating his
works!)&mdash;and all rivers wind: Allah
forbid that my canal should be better
than His river; it shall wind too.'"</p>

<p>And so it does.</p>

<p>Landed at Cairo, the traveller of
the present day will find a steamer
once a fortnight ready to take him up
to the first cataract and back again,
as fast as Young Rapid, or any other
son of a tailor, could desire. But
even the rational tourist will be
tempted to send on his Kandjiah,
(the old-fashioned Nile boat,) well
found and provisioned, a fortnight or
three weeks before him, and overtake
her in the steamer. The Kandjiah
voyage up stream is often wearisome,
downward never&mdash;as in the
descent you are borne softly along
at from three to six miles an hour,
even when you sleep. From the first
cataract to the second is only about
two hundred miles, and occupies
about three weeks; but to those who
can find pleasure in what is most wild
and dreamy and unearthly in scenery
and art, the desert view from Mount
Abousir, the temples of Guerf, Hassan,
and Ipsamboul, are worth all the rest
of the Nile voyage, except Thebes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[721]</a></span>
and exquisite Philæ.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Returned to
Alexandria, as we will suppose, in
March, the traveller will be quite
early enough for Syria, whose winter
(considering the tented life he is compelled
to lead) is not to be despised.
A steamer transports him to Beyrout
in thirty hours; and there our true
travel begins.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
11 A: The mere physical pleasure of the upper voyage has been thus described&mdash;"No
words can convey an idea of the beauty and delightfulness of tropical weather, at
least while any breeze from the north is blowing. There is a pleasure in the very
act of breathing&mdash;a voluptuous consciousness that existence is a blessed thing: the
pulse beats high, but calmly; the eye feels expanded; the chest heaves pleasureably,
as if air was a delicious draught to thirsty lungs; and the mind takes its colouring
and character from sensation. No thought of melancholy ever darkens over us&mdash;no
painful sense of isolation or of loneliness, as day after day we pass on through silent
deserts, upon the silent and solemn river. One seems, as it were, removed into
another state of existence; and all the strifes and struggles of that from which we
have emerged seem to fade, softened into indistinctness. This is what Homer and
Alfred Tennyson knew that the lotus-eaters felt when they tasted of the mysterious
tree of this country, and became weary of their wanderings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'&mdash;&mdash;To him the gushing of the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far away, did seem to mourn and rave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On alien shores: and, if his fellow spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was thin, as voices from the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep asleep he seemed, yet all awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music in his ears his beating heart did make.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">If the day, with all the tyranny of its sunshine and its innumerable insects, be
enjoyable in the tropics, the night is still more so. The stars shine out with diamond
brilliancy, and appear as large as if seen through a telescope. Their changing
colours, the wake of light they cast upon the water, the distinctness of the milky
way, and the splendour, above all, of the evening star, give one the impression of being
under a different firmament from that to which we have been accustomed; then
the cool delicious airs, with all the strange and stilly sounds they bear from the
desert and the forest; the delicate scents they scatter, and the languid breathings
with which they make our large white sails appear to pant, as they heave and languish
softly over the water."&mdash;(<cite>The Crescent and the Cross</cite>, vol. i. p. 210.)]</p>

<p>Thus, (omitting the somewhat
important episode of Egypt,) we find
ourselves transported, in little more
than a fortnight, from the murky fogs
and leafless trees of England, to the
delicious temperature and tropical verdure
that surrounds the most beautiful
town of the Levant. As every
improvement in steam-navigation
lessens its distance from Christendom,
Beyrout increases and expands.
Nor must we omit an honest tribute
to the iron but even-handed justice
of Ibrahim Pasha, which first rendered
it safely accessible to Europeans.
Before his conquest of Syria,
the Frank was wont to skulk anxiously
through the town, exposed to
insult and unpunished violence:
without the walls, the robber enjoyed
as much impunity as the bigot did
within; and, between both, Beyrout
became, or continued to be, a miserable
village. Its environs were wild
wastes, where the gipsy alone ventured
to pitch his tent, and the wild
dog prowled. Now, pleasant gardens
and picturesque kiosks, or summer-houses,
replace the wilderness; the
town expands, grows clean, doubles
its population, and welcomes a crowd
of shipping to its port. A more delightful
residence, as a refuge from
winter, can scarcely be conceived.
An infinite variety of excursions may
be made from hence; and every time
the traveller mounts his horse, whether
he be historically, picturesquely,
controversially, botanically, or geologically
given, he may return to his
flat-roofed home with some valuable
acquisition to his note-book. The views
are everywhere magnificent, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
warm breezes from the bluest of
oceans are tempered by the snowy
neighbourhood of the loveliest of
mountains.</p>

<p>Five roads of leading interest (besides
many a cheering byway among
the hills) branch out from the walls
of Beyrout. Damascus is about
eighteen hours off; Jerusalem six
days; Djouni, the romantic residence
and burial-place of Lady Hester Stanhope,
ten hours; Baalbec, the flower
of all Eastern ruins, eighteen hours,
and Latakia, whither <em>we</em> are bound,
five days. These distances may be
accomplished in less time; they are
here given at the calculation of a
walking pace, as the roads, or rather
paths, are for the most part steep and
difficult; and the baggage-horses, at
all events, can seldom advance more
rapidly. One word more of dry detail,
and we shall put ourselves <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i> for the mountains of the Ansayrii
and the further East. Notwithstanding
the advance of civilisation
at Beyrout, where a European
consulocracy has established a more
than European equality of privileges
between Turks and Christians, the
interior of the country is daily becoming
more dangerous to travel in.
Eight years ago, when the stern rule
of Ibrahim Pasha had still left its
beneficent traces, the writer of this
article wandered over the length and
breadth of the land, attended by a
single servant and a muleteer. Since
our Government, for inscrutable reasons,
has restored Syria to the embroilment
of its native factions, all
security for the traveller, and indeed
for the native, has ceased. To reach
Jerusalem, or even Damascus, in
safety, a considerable escort is now
necessary; though the Vale of Baalbec
may still be reached in less warlike
fashion from Latakia or Tripoli,
if the traveller is endowed with liberality,
courage, and courtesy&mdash;the
leading virtues of his profession.</p>

<p>Before we proceed on our travels,
let us introduce our guide. Mr Walpole
is a young naval officer, and
there is in most of his narrative a
dashing impetuous style, which savours
of his profession. In this there is a
certain charm, imparting as it does
an air of frank and fearless confidence
in his reader's quick perception and
favourable construction. There is in
his writings what we would also hope
is professional&mdash;a chivalrous feeling
and generous sentiment, that is never
obscured by a sordid thought or unworthy
imputation. As he sees clearly,
of course he also sees faults in men,
and minds, and manners; but such
discoveries are made in a tone of regret
rather than of triumph; or thrown
off in a strain of good-humoured
satire that could not offend even its
objects. His descriptive powers are
graphic, and often very vivid; his
humour is very original, being generally
tinged with melancholy, in such
sort as that of a philanthropic Jacques
might be: finally, he does not fear
to display a profound and manly reverence
for holy things and sacred
places. On the other hand, to set
against all these high merits, we must
confess that many faults afford some
drawback to his book. It is often incoherent,
and deficient in arrangement.
The first volume is rather the groundwork
than the accomplishment of
what an author with Mr Walpole's
powers and material should have
effected. Most of these faults, however,
may find their excuse in the circumstances
under which they were composed.
They smack of the tent, the
boat, and the bivouac, as old wine
does of the <i>borachio</i>. Whatever they
may be, this work is one that will be
widely read; and wherever it is read
with appreciation, it will direct the
interest not only to its subject, but its
author: his individuality, unostentatiously
and unconsciously, is impressed
on every page; and his genius, however
erratic, is unquestionable.</p>

<p>The cockpit, and even the gun-room
of a man-of-war, are little
favourable to intellectual effort, or
the habit or the love of learning
which it can alone accomplish. We
can therefore make greater allowances
for errors in composition, and
concede greater credit for the attainments
in languages and general knowledge
which our young author has
achieved. This is perhaps still more
striking in a work written by Mr Walpole
three years ago, entitled <cite>Four
Years in the Pacific</cite>, which, though
written in a midshipman's berth,
abounds in passages of beauty, and in
his peculiar and original humour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
Having said so much in his praise and
dispraise, and only premising, in addition,
that he speaks Arabic and Turkish,
so as to interpret for himself the
quaint unusual thoughts of the people
among whom he lives, we enter upon
a survey of what he saw.</p>

<p>We have unwillingly passed over
the whole of our author's outward voyage,
which is graphically, and almost
dramatically, described. We shall only
refer to one or two passages respecting
the Levant. The following sentence
may dispel some fanciful visions
of the sunny climate of Stamboul:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Snow, 'thick and deep' enveloped the
city; cupola, dome, and cypress were
burdened with icicles; above, was an
angry winter sky with a keenly piercing
wind.... English fires and English
coals were the best things we saw&mdash;we
were actually blockaded by the
weather.... At length we embarked:
the crew were shovelling the deep
snow-drift off the deck, so we rushed
below into a cabin whose bulkheads
were beautifully varnished, sofas perfect,
skylights closed, the whole atmosphere
tobacco. We were off, gliding past the
Seraglio Point, which was swathed in
snow, and looking like a man in summer
clothes caught in a wintry storm....
Masses animate and inanimate encumbered
the deck; the former for the most
part consisting of the Sultan's subjects;
among the latter our baggage, which was
thrown into the general heap, and kicked
about until it found quiet in the hold....
The numbers thus congregated
were principally pilgrims, on their
way to Jerusalem and to the Jordan;
though others, on more worldly journey
bent, were mingled with the rest. Each
family had taken a spot on the deck,
and there, piled over with coverings,
and surrounded with their goods, they
remained during the voyage: one side
of the after-deck was alone kept clear
for the first-class passengers, and even
this was often invaded by others, who
wisely remarked that <em>we</em> had cabins
below.</p>

<p>"Each family forms a scene in itself;
and an epitome of life in the East is
found by a glance around. Four merchants,
on their return from a trading
tour, have bivouacked between the skylights;
and they sing and are sick; call
<i>kief</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and smoke, with true Moslem indifference.
On the starboard quarter, our
notions of Eastern domesticity are sadly
put out, for there a Moslem husband is
mercilessly bullied by a shrill-voiced
Houri. It is curious to observe her perseverance
in covering her face, even during
the agonies of sea-sickness. Their
black servant has taken us into the number
of licensed ones, and her veil now
hangs over her neck like a loosened neck-cloth.</p>

<p>"On the other side, a Greek family in
three generations lies along the deck,
fortified by a stout man-servant across
their legs, whose attentions to the girls
during his own heart-rending ailments
is very pretty. The huge grandmother
was set on fire and smouldered away
most stoically, until her foot began to
burn, when, while others put her out, she
sank blubbering to sleep again. The
pretty granddaughters find the long prostration
more irksome; but send their
flashing eyes about with careless movement,
and so the mass goes on. Here
one appears to be offering up <i>nazam</i>, but
nearer inspection shows that his shoe is
only receiving the offering to the heaving
waves....</p>

<p>"Our steamer had passed sad hours of
toil, and pitched and tossed us all out of
temper before we entered the calm
waters to leeward of Rhodes, and at last,
passing the low points covered with
detached houses and windmills, we shot
round in front of the harbour. Our view
of the intervening coast had been too
vague to form a judgment upon it; but
here and there a peak towered up above
the mists, all else being veiled by the
cloudy sky.... No place it has
ever been my fortune to visit, more, by
its appearance, justifies its character than
Rhodes. Around the harbour's shore,
one continued line of high castellated
wall, unbroken save by flanking towers
or frowning portals; from the wave on
either side, dovetailed to the rock, rise
the knightly buildings; and as the eye
reaches round, no dissonant work mars
the effect, save that one lofty palm rears
its tropic head&mdash;but it adds to, rather
than lessens, the effect. Above the walls,
a mosque with its domed roof or minaret
appears; and the fragile building speaks,
how truly! in its contrast to the massive
walls and ponderous works of former
rulers, that the battle is not always to
the strong."</p></blockquote>

<p>In speaking of the sister island-fortress,
Malta, our author remarks
(in a former page) the immediate contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
presented by these luxurious
arsenals:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Eastern reclines on the cushioned
divan, the embodiment of repose; the
softest carpets, the freshest flowers, surround
him&mdash;soft women attend the
slightest motion of his eye&mdash;all breathes
of indolence, abandonment, and ease; yet
his girdle bristles with arms&mdash;his gates
are locked and guarded. So at Malta,
the bower is a bastion, the saloon a casemate,
the serenade the call of martial
music, the draperies war-flags, the ornaments
shot in ready proximity."</p></blockquote>

<p>Proceeding to Tarsus, we pass on
to Alexandretta, "a wretched collection
of hovels. The harbour is splendid;
the ruins of the old, the skeleton
of the new town, standing on the
beach. Behind it, in every direction,
stretches a fetid and swampy plain,
which only requires drainage to be
rendered fertile and wholesome."
This is the seaport of Aleppo, on the
road to which lies the town of Beilau,
and the village of Mortawan, where
Pagan rites, especially those of Venus,
are still said to be maintained. But
again we reimbark&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Again the vessel cuts the wave. The
mountains become a feeble bleached outline,
save Cassius on the north, who
frowns on his unrecorded fame. Yes,
noble hill! though not so high as Strabo
tells, though not lofty and imposing;
though dark thy path now&mdash;unnoticed,
solitary. There blazed up the last effort
of the flame of pagan civilisation: there
Julian the Great&mdash;whatever other title
men may bestow upon him&mdash;offered his
solemn sacrifice to Jupiter the Avenger,
previous to his last campaign, when
the eagles were to wave over Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>"The Sabbath dawned fresh, unclouded,
and beautiful, as we anchored in the
pretty little port of Latakia, the ancient
Laodicea. The town of Latakia, built
by Seleucus Nicator, in honour of his
mother, is comprehended in the Pashalic
of Saida, or Beyrout. It stands on a
spur of the Ansayrii Mountains. About
half a mile inland, the spur falls into the
sea, and forms Cape Zairet; the town
stands on its southern slope, and is joined,
by gardens and a port, to the sea. The
port is small and well sheltered; but
time, Turks, and ruins, are filling it up.
The buildings on the shore, having their
backs to the sea, present the appearance
of a fortification. On a reef of rock that
shelters the harbour stands a pile of
building of different eras. It seems to
be castle, mosque, and church. Along
the beach lie hundreds of shafts of
columns, and many are built into the
walls, of whose remains you catch a
glimpse on the southern side."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we must pause, though our
traveller proceeds to Beyrout, of
which he gives a charming account,
which our limits forbid us to quote.
We reserve our space for more novel
scenes, and must pass over a chapter
on Damascus, which is rich in legends
and graphic pictures. Thence, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i> to Homs, by the way of the
desert, eastward of the Anti-Lebanon,
we have a sketch that is too characteristic
of Eastern travel to pass
over:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"North, south and east, dead plain;
west, a low range of hills, and beyond,
the fair Anti-Lebanon in all its snowy
beauty. Desert all around us, but no
dreary waste. Here and there were
loose stones and rocks; the rest a carpet
of green, fresh, dewy grass, filled with
every hue of wild-flowers&mdash;the poppy in
its gorgeous red, the hyacinth, the simple
daisy and others, thick as they could
struggle up, all freshened with a breeze
heavy with the scents of thyme. The
lark sent forth its thrill of joy in welcome
to the coming day; before us the
pennon of the spearmen gleamed as they
wound along the plain. We passed the
site of an Arab encampment strewn with
fire-blackened stones, bones, and well
picked carcasses. Storks and painted
quails sauntered slowly away at our approach,
or perched and looked as if they
questioned our right to pass. At eight
o'clock halted at a khan called Hasiah
also. The population consisting of robust,
wild-looking fellows; and very pretty
women poured out to sell hard-boiled
eggs, leban, bread, and milk: they were
all Mussulmans....</p>

<p>"We were soon disturbed by a multitude
of sick, which recalled to one's mind
how in this land, of old, the same style
of faces, probably in the same costumes,
crowded to Him who healed. The lame,
carried by the healthy; feeble mothers
with sickly babes; hale men showing
wounds long self-healed; others with or
without complaints."</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrived at Homs, we have&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fish for dinner, from the Lake of
Kades, whose blue waters we saw in the
distance to-day. The Lebanon opens
behind that lake, and you may pass to
the sea, on the plain, without a hill.
This plain, but rarely visited, is among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
the most interesting portions of Syria,
containing numerous convents, castles,
and ruins, and its people are still but
little known. Maszyad, the principal
seat of the sect called Ismayly: the Ansayrii
also, and Koords, besides Turks,
Christians, and gipsys, may be found
among its varied population. The ancient
castle of El Hoshn, supposed, by the
lions over its gates, to have been built
by the Count of Thoulouse, is well worth
a visit. The Orontes, taking its rise in
a rock, from whence it gushes just west
of the Tel of Khroumee,&mdash;(true bearing
from Homs from south 60° 32' east,)&mdash;flows
through the Lake of Kades, and
passes about 2° to the west of Homs: it
is called Nahr El Aazzy, or "the rebel
river," some say because of its running
north, while all the other rivers run
south; more probably, however, on
account of its rapidity and strength of
current. It is an historical stream; on
its banks were altars, and the country it
waters is almost unmatched for beauty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh, sacred stream! whose dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the fragments of the altars of idolatry.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>It was at Homs&mdash;the ancient
Emessa&mdash;that Zenobia was brought
as a captive into the presence of
Aurelian.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why did she not there fall? why
add the remaining lustreless years to
her else glorious life? why, in the words
of Gibbon, sink insensibly into the
Roman matron? Zenobia fat, dowdy,
and contented&mdash;profanation! Zimmerman,
however, invests the close of her
career with graceful philosophy: at
Tivoli, in happy tranquillity, she fed the
greatness of her soul with the noble
images of Homer, and the exalted precepts
of Plato; supported the adversity of her
fortunes with fortitude and resignation,
and learnt that the anxieties attendant
on ambition are happily exchanged for
the enjoyments of ease and the comforts
of philosophy."</p></blockquote>

<p>From Homs we reach Aleppo in
four days.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was a spring morning, and a gentle
keenness, wafted from snow-clad mountains,
rendered the climate delightful.
The town lay beneath me, and each
terrace, court, serai, and leewan lay open
to my view. I saw Aleppo was built in
a hollow, from which ran plains north
and west, surrounded by mountains. To
the north, Djebel Ma Hash and his range,
untouched by the soft smiles of the young
spring, lay deep in the snow; the flat
connected grass-grown roofs and well-watered
sparkling courts, with their
carefully-tended trees, relieving the glare
of the houses, while all around the town
lay belted in its garden. The scene was
pretty and pleasing; here and there the
forests of tomb-stones, the perfect minaret,
the Eastern dome swelling up from
the mob of flat roofs,&mdash;these formed a
sight that told I was in the East, in the
cradle of mankind&mdash;the home of history."...</p>

<p>"And here, though sorely pressed for
time, we must stop for a picnic, which
E&mdash;&mdash; and myself were told it would be
right to give. We provided carpets, nargillehs,
horse-loads of sundries, cushions,
a cargo of lettuces; and thus equipped,
we sallied out, a very numerous party.
The first thing to select was a garden, a
point on which our own choice, and not
the owner's will, seemed alone to be consulted.
Let not the reader fancy an
Eastern garden is what a warm Western
fancy would paint it&mdash;wild with luxuriant
but weedless verdure, heavy with the
scent of roses and jessamine, thrilling
with the songs of the bulbul and the
nightingale, where fair women with
plaited tresses touch the soulful lute in
graceful attitudes. No; it is a piece of
ground enclosed by high walls, varying
in size. A wretched gate, invariably
badly made, probably ruined, admits you
to the interior. Some enclose a house
with two or three rooms&mdash;windowless,
white-washed places. Before this is a
reservoir of dirty, stagnant water, turned
up from a neighbouring well by an apparatus
as rude as it is ungainly and
laborious: this is used to irrigate the
ground, which therefore is alternately
mud and dust. Fruit trees or mulberries
are planted in rows, and the ground
beneath, being ploughed up, is productive
of vegetables or corn. One or two trees,
for ornament, may be planted in the first
row, but nothing more; and weeds, uncut,
undestroyed, spring up in every
direction. Such, without exaggeration,
is the <i>Bistan zareff quiess!</i>&mdash;the Lovely
Garden.</p>

<p>"We selected one that belonged to
the Mollah. Oh, true believer! in thy
pot we boiled a ham; on thy divan we
ate the forbidden beast; thy gardener,
for base reward, assisting to cook&mdash;who
knows, but also to eat the same? We
chose a spot shaded by a noble walnut
tree, and spread carpets and cushions.
Fire was lighted, nargillehs bubbled,
and kief began."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 2d of May we start for the
Euphrates, and follow for some time
nearly the route recommended by
Colonel Chesney for the great Indian
railway to Bussora, on the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
Gulph. The distance is little more
than 800 miles&mdash;scarcely thirty steam-winged
hours&mdash;the level surpassingly
uniform. Truly those who desire to
find either solitude, or what our author
calls <i>kief</i>, in the East, must
repair thither quickly, for the iron of
the engineer has already entered into
its soul. Already the blue and white
rivers of the Nile are more easily
attainable than were the Tiber and
the Po to our grandfathers. Beyrout
and Latakia will soon be fashionable
watering-places; Baalbec as well
known as Melrose Abbey; and the
excavated ruins of Nimroud will come
under the range of "return tickets."
The grim Arab will look out from
any quiet spot that the all-searching
Cockney may have spared him; and
he will gaze with wonder on the awful
processions of the "devil-goaded"
tourists, as they rush with magic
speed across his wilderness&mdash;only to
retrace their steps. The Turk, at the
utmost bounds of the Othman Empire,
will marvel at this new freak of
<i>kismet</i> (destiny;) with a sigh he will
abandon his beloved <i>bockra</i> (the "to-morrow"
in which he loves to live;)
and commending himself to Islam, or
resignation in its most trying form,
he will "jump in" like the mere
Giaours, and be hurled along with
the rest across the desert behind the
Afreet stoker.</p>

<p>But at present the wilderness knows
nothing of all this, and we have before
us the scenery of other days as
Abram beheld it. We now cross the
Chalus River, and enter upon a
series of vast plains, varied by mysterious
<i>tels</i> or mounds, rising up from
the level surface like bubbles on a
pool. On, or among these, the ever
restless Turkomans pitch their tents,
and welcome the traveller kindly to
their wandering homes. On the third
day from Aleppo we reach Aintab,
on the river Sadschur, "which, fresh
and young, danced brightly on, as if
eager to join the Euphrates and see
the wide world beyond."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At Aintab, among other visitors was
Doctor Smith, an American missionary.
He was a well-bred, sensible man, a
clever linguist, and, from all I ever
heard, an earnest and zealous servant
of his heavenly Master. His mission already
shows results which must indeed
be a source of peace to his heart, and
proves that some are allowed even in
this world to reap the fruits of their toil
for the Lord. In that very town, whence
a few years ago he was insulted and
abused, a faithful flock now join in humble
prayers to God; and surely they
pray for him, the instrument of their
salvation. I was much pleased at the
plain unexaggerating way in which he told
the history of his mission.... The
good work has progressed, and he now
has from one hundred and fifty to three
hundred pupils in his school, many the
children of non-converted parents. And
in this year's enrolment&mdash;great glory to
our ambassador at Constantinople!&mdash;the
Protestants are enrolled as a separate
religious community: the males are two
hundred and odd here.</p>

<p>"All sects recognised by the Porte are
enrolled separately, as their taxes, &amp;c.,
are apportioned by their own heads
(chiefs.)"</p></blockquote>

<p>Many of the Armenians here have
been converted to the Church of
England, and this has proved to be a
most advantageous change for their
women.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They are now emancipated from the
bondage they have so long been held in&mdash;I
do not mean personal bondage, for
perhaps there is less of it in the East
than in the West&mdash;but their whole moral
position has undergone a vast change.
The man is now first taught that the
woman is his best friend; his firmest,
truest companion; his equal in the social
scale, as God made her&mdash;a help meet for
him, not a mere piece of household furniture.
The woman is also taught to
reverence the man as her head; thus
imparting that beautiful lesson, 'He for
God only, she for God through him.'
She is also taught perhaps a harder lesson,
a more painful task&mdash;to relinquish
all her costly ornaments, when such may
be more usefully employed in trade and
traffic; to consider necessaries more
beautiful than costly clothes or embroidered
suits. Gradually she is allowed
to unite with the man in prayers, which
is permitted by no other sect in the East,
women always having a portion of the
church set apart for them, and the Moslems
praying at different times. May it
please Him who gives and dispenses all
things, to prosper this and all other good
and holy works!... On leaving
Aintab, we passed over the hills that
environ the town, and entered a pretty
valley, through which the Sadschur river
accompanies us. Here, at a small village
called Naringa, we chose a pretty spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
under some trees, and pitched our tents.
The horses browsed at our door, the
stream jumped by before us as we took
our evening's repose. And repose it is
to sit thus at the close of a day of travel,
to enjoy the view of the lovely regions
given man to dwell in; to see the various
changes time, circumstances, and religion
have wrought in the family of Adam,
or, as the Arabs say, in the Beni Adam.
It was a lovely evening; and as I reclined
apart from my more gregarious
fellow-travellers, I felt</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That the night was filled with music,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the cares that infested the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had folded their tents, like the Arab,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as silently stolen away.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>From Naringa our route lies eastward
over low undulated hills, still
marked by frequent <i>tels</i>, generally
surmounted by a village. "Are
these mounds natural, or does man
still fondly cling to the ruined home
of his fathers?" Crossing the river
Kirsan, we arrive at Nezeeb, lying
among vineyards and plantations of
figs, pistachios, and olives, interspersed
with fields of wheat. At this
village the Sultan's forces, 70,000
strong, were defeated by Ibrahim
Pasha with 45,000 men&mdash;a bootless
victory, soon neutralised by a few lines
from our "Foreign Office." On the
6th day after leaving Aleppo, we find
ourselves on the Euphrates, the
<i>Mourad Shai</i>, or "Water of desire."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In all its majesty, it glides beneath
our gaze. It is needless to tell the history
of this river, renowned in the earliest
traditions. Watering the Paradise of
earth, it has been mingled with the fables
of heaven; the Lord gave it in his covenants
unto Abram; Moses, inspired,
preached it in his sermon to the people.
In its waters are bound the four angels,
and, at the emptying of the sixth vial,
its waters will dry up, that the 'way of
the kings of the East may be prepared.'
In every age it has formed a prominent
feature in the diorama of history, flashing
with sunshine, or sluggish and turbid
with blood; and here, on its bank, its
name unchanged, all now is solitude and
quiet.</p>

<p>"Descending amidst wide burial-grounds,
where here and there a <i>kubbé</i>
sheltered some clay more revered than
the rest, we reached its shores, and
patiently took up our quarters beneath
the shade of a tree, till a boat should
arrive to carry us over. The redoubt,
Fort William, as it was called, of the
Euphrates expedition still remains. In
ancient times four shallows existed where
there were bridges over the Euphrates:
the northernmost at Samosata, now unused;
Rum Kalaat, further south, being
the route frequented; Bir, the khan and
eastern bank of which is called Zeugma,
or the Bridge, to this day; and the
fourth at Thapsacus, the modern Thapsaish,
where Cyrus, Alexander, and
Crassus passed into Mesopotamia. The
Arabs now generally pass here, or else
by fords known only to themselves.
Julian crossed at a place called Menbidjy,
which was probably abreast of
Hierapolis.</p>

<p>"But what avails to recount individual
cases?&mdash;the whole land is history. Near
us is Racca, once the favourite residence
of Aaron the Just. Here he delighted
to spend his leisure&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Entranced with that place and time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So worthy of the golden prime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good Haroun Alraschid.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>We cross the Euphrates to the
town of Bir, and proceed still eastward,
along a flat desert, strewn with
a small-bladed scanty grass, aromatic
flowers, and wormwood. "One
small gleam, like a polished shield or
a dark sward, is all we see of the
mighty river that flows around us.
Every hour of the day changes the
aspect of the desert: now it is wild
and gloomy, as scudding clouds pass
over the sun; now smiling with
maiden sweetness, as the sun shines
out again." Often we pass by the
tented homes of the desert tribes,
with their flocks and herds tended
by busy maidens, now screaming
wildly after their restless charge&mdash;now
singing songs as wild, but
sweeter far. Then comes sunset with
its massed clouds of purple, blue, and
gold; the air is full of bleatings as
the flocks all tamely follow their
shepherds home. On the tenth day
after leaving Aleppo, we descend into
a plain covered with some dusty
olive-trees: we come to a hill with a
low wall, and a castle on its summit.
"And this is the Ur of the Chaldees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
the Edessa of the Romans, the Orfa
of the Arabs. Here God spake to
Abram." From this city, very fruitful
in legends, we reach Haran in six
hours; travelling over a plain strewn
with <i>tels</i> and encampments of the
Koords.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Perhaps by this very route Abraham
of old and those with him travelled; nor
is it extravagance to say, the family we
now meet may exhibit the exact appearance
that the patriarchs did four thousand
years ago&mdash;the tents and pots piled
on the camels; the young children in one
saddle-bag balancing the kids in the
other; the matron astride on the ass; the
maid following modestly behind; the
boys now here, now there; the patriarch
himself on his useful mare, following and
directing the march. As we pass, he
lays his hand on his heart, and says,
'Peace be with you; where are you
going?&mdash;Depart in peace.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Haran appears to be, without
doubt, the ancient city of Nahor,
where Laban lived, and where Jacob
served for Leah and Rachel. Here,
too, is Rebekah's well, and here our
traveller beheld the very counterpart
of the scene that Eleazar saw when he
sought a bride for his master's son. By
this time our author had so far identified
himself with the desert tribes, their
language, their interests, their enjoyment
of the desert life, and their love
of horses, that he seems to feel, and
almost to speak, in the Arab style.
We have never seen that interesting
people so happily described and so
vividly illustrated. If we had not so
much before us still to investigate,
we would gladly dwell upon the
desert journey from Haran to Tel
Bagdad, and on the raft voyage
thence down the Tigris to Mosul.
One graphic sketch of an Arab sheik
must serve for many: his characteristic
speech contains volumes of
his people's history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The young sheik was not, probably,
more than seventeen or eighteen years of
age; handsome, but with that peculiarly
girlish effeminate appearance I have before
mentioned as so frequently found
among the younger aristocracy of the
desert, and so strangely belied by their
character and deeds. He now held my
horse, and, apologising for his father's
temporary absence, welcomed us. The
tent was large and well made. We remained
here smoking and drinking coffee
till the sheik Dahhal arrived. He was
fully dressed in silk&mdash;a fine figure of a
man with light clear eyes. Wounds,
received long ago, have incapacitated
him from the free use of his hands, but
report says he can still grasp the rich
dagger at his girdle with a fatal strength
when passion urges him. Though every
feeling was subdued, there showed
through all his mildness the baffled tiger,
whose vengeance would be fearful&mdash;he
resembled a netted animal, vainly with
all its cunning seeking to break the
meshes that encompassed him on all
sides.</p>

<p>"He received us with a hospitality
that seemed natural; his words were
more sonorous, grand, and flowing than
those of any Arab I had before seen.
They reminded me of the pleasure I had
felt in South America in listening to the
language of a true Spaniard, heard amidst
the harsh gutturals of a provincial jargon;
strings of highflown compliments, uttered
with an open, noble mien, that, while it
must please those to whom it is used,
seems but a worthy condescension in him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'He was a man of war and woes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet on his lineaments ye cannot trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While gentleness her milder radiance throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along that aged venerable face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"If report speaks true, never did there
breathe a truer son of Hagar than Sheik
Dahhal. During his whole life his hand
has been against every man, and every
man's against him. Gaining his social
position with his dagger, he openly endeavoured
to enlarge it by every exercise
of force or fraud. The whole frontier of
Mardin, Nisibis, Mosul, Bagdad, &amp;c., are
his deadly enemies, made so by his acts.
It must be sad in declining years to see
the wreck of a youth thus spent; already
the punishment and repayment are hard
at hand.</p>

<p>"Successful violence brings temporary
rewards&mdash;power, rule, dominion; but for
this he has bartered honour, fame, youth,
conscience: every stake, every ruse, has
been used, and he gains but defeat, disgrace,
and contempt. It must be hard,
very hard, for the proud man to live on
thus. I pitied him, and could feel for
him as he fondled his young son, a lovely
little naked savage, who lay crouching at
his side. He had two or three other
children, all strikingly handsome....</p>

<p>"We were ultimately obliged to refuse
his escort. 'It is well,' said he, 'whether
you go or stay, all Dahhal has, all his
enemies have left him, is yours.' We
asked him if he saw any change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
Arab since he remembered: he looked
quietly round at his tents, at his camels
now crowded round them, the flocks lowing
to their homes; his dress, his arms,
and then said, 'No: since the time of
the Prophets&mdash;since time was, we are
unchanged; perhaps poorer, perhaps less
hospitable in consequence; but otherwise
unchanged.' He made a very just remark
afterwards: 'Our habits are the
only ones adapted to the country we live
in; they cannot change unless we change
our country: no other life can be lived
here.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Our travellers, sending their horses
and servants along the banks of the
Tigris, themselves embarked on board
a raft composed of inflated skins;
and their voyage, after many incidents,
terminated in the following
scene:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At last the pious true-believing eye
of the boatman detected the minarets of
Mosul over the low land on the right.
On our left was a large temporary village,
built of dried grass, roughly and coarsely
framed; low peaked mountains ahead
broke the steel line of the sky. No sooner
did our boatman detect the minarets,
than he continued his prayers, confiding
the oars to one of the servants. Poor
fellow! it was sad work; for the raft, as
if in revenge for the way he had pulled
her about, kept pertinaciously turning,
and as it bore his Mecca&mdash;turned front
to the north, east, or west&mdash;he had to
stop his pious invocations, that otherwise
would have been wafted to some useless
bourne; and then, as in the swing she
turned him to the black stone, he had to
hurry on, like sportsmen anxious for
some passing game. Often he rose, but
seemed not satisfied, and again he knelt,
and bowing prayed his Caaba-directing
prayers. This man had not prayed before
during the voyage.</p>

<p>"At last, over the land appeared a
mud fort hardly distinguishable from the
hill; before it a white-washed dome, a
few straggling buildings&mdash;it was Mosul.
Presently an angle is turned, and the
broken ruinous wall of an Eastern town
lies before us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mosul is only sixteen days' journey
from Aleppo. Although now invested
with a lasting interest by its connection
with Mr Layard's magnificent discoveries,
it is one of the least attractive
cities of the East. Its neighbourhood,
with the grand exception
of buried Nineveh, and some curious
naphtha springs, is equally devoid of
interest. The huge mound called
Koyunjik, "coverer of cities," lies on
the opposite side of the Tigris, about
two miles from the river. Tel Nimroud,
where the first successful excavations
were made, is about eighteen
miles lower down. It will be remembered
that Mr Rich, a merchant of
Bagdad, first directed attention to
these subterranean treasures nearly
twenty years ago: M. Botta, more
recently, made some energetic attempts
to discover them; but it remained
for our gallant countryman,
Mr Layard, to render his name illustrious
by unveiling the mysteries of
ages, and restoring to light the wonders
of the ancient capital of the
Assyrians. His renown, and still
more his success itself, must be its
own reward; but we fear that in all
other respects the nation is still
deeply in his debt. The capricious
liberalities of our Government with
respect to art are very singular; the
financial dispositions of the British
Museum are still more difficult to explain.
The former does not hesitate
to bestow £2500 on transporting a
pillar from the sea-shore of Egypt to
London, while it only places at Mr
Layard's disposal £3000 for the excavation
of Nineveh and its surrounding
suburbs, eighteen miles in extent&mdash;together
with the support and
pay of a numerous staff of artists
and others during eighteen months.
On the other hand, the trustees of
the British Museum, knowing themselves
already to be deeply in Mr
Layard's debt, refuse to further his
great efforts, except by the paltry
(and refused) pittance of £12 a-month;
and, at the same time, they
furnish Colonel Rawlinson with the
sum of £2000 to proceed with excavations
at Koyunjik, (three hundred
miles from his residence,) and at
Susa, which is one-third of the distance.
In the approaching session
of Parliament, we hope that Mr
Layard's services to England and to
art will be more generously appreciated
than they have hitherto been;
and that, at all events, we shall not
be left to labour under the disgrace of
pecuniary debt to that enterprising
gentleman.</p>

<p>We have now reached our traveller's
goal, and must make brief work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
of his returning tour, in order to spare
some columns to the consideration of
the Ansayrii, the most important
matter in the work.</p>

<p>After a residence of some weeks at
Mosul, and at the several neighbouring
excavations, Mr Walpole accompanied
Mr Layard in a tour through
the fastnesses of Koordistan: and
here we must find space for one or
two glimpses at those unknown
regions, and the life that awaits the
traveller there.</p>

<p>Before we begin to ascend the hill
country, we look back:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On either side, the mountain falls
away with jut and crag almost perpendicularly
to the plain; at the foot, hills rise
above hills in irregular and petulant
ranges, like a stormy sea when the wind
is gone, and nothing save its memory
remains, lashing the waves with restless
motion. Westward lies the vast plain,
its surface broken by the mounds of imperial
cities long passed away.</p>

<p>"One moment the eye rests on the Tigris
as it glides its vast volume by; then, out
upon the plain, the desert broken by the
range of Singar, again on to distance
where earth and air mingle imperceptibly
together. To the south, over a varied
land, is Mosul, the white glare of its
mosque glistening in the sun; to the south
and east, a sea of hills, wave after wave,
low and irregular. The Zab, forcing its
way, takes a tortuous course to its companion;
farther on, they join their waters,
and run together to the vast worlds of
the south. Beyond are Arbela and the
Obeid. Kara Chout and its crags shut
out the view, passing many a spot graven
on the pages of the younger world.</p>

<p>"What a blank in history is there
around those vast cities, now brought to
light! A few vague traditions, a few
names whose fabulous actions throw discredit
on their existence, are all that
research has discovered. Even the nations
following after these we know but
dimly&mdash;tradition, garlanded by poetry,
our only guide.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"Fancy conjures up to the south a
small and compact body of Greeks: around
them, at a distance, like vultures round
a struggling carcase, hover bands of
cavalry. Now, as a gap opens, they
rush on; now, as the ranks close up, they
melt away, shooting arrows as they fly,
vengeful in their cowardice&mdash;it is the
retreat of Xenophon and his gallant
band. They encamp at Nimroud&mdash;as in
his yesterday, so in our to-day, a mound
smothering its own renown.</p>

<p>"Northward again comes a mighty
band: with careful haste they cross the
rivers, and with confident step traverse
the plain south. On the south-east plain,
a legion of nations, golden, glittering,
yet timorous, await their approach.
Alexander, the hero, scatters dismay:
assured of conquest ere he met the foe,
he esteems the pursuit the only difficulty.
On the one side, Asia musters her nations&mdash;Indians,
Syrians, Albanians, and Bactrians&mdash;the
hardiest population of her
empire. Elephants and war-chariots are
of no avail: the result was fore-written,
and Darius foremost flies along the plain.</p>

<p>"Faint, afar, we can see in the north-west
Lucullus; and the arms of Rome
float over the walls of Nisibis, (<small>B.C.</small> 68.)
We may almost see the glorious array of
Julian; hear him subduing his mortal
pain; hear him pronounce, with well-modulated
tones, one of the finest orations
the world can record. We may
see the timid Jovian skulking in his
purple from the field he dared not defend
in his armour. But again rise up the
legions and the Labarum: Heraclius
throws aside his lethargy; the earth
drinks deep of gore, and Khosroo<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is
vanquished under our eyes.</p>

<p>"The white and the black banners now
gleam upon the field; the crescent flaunts
on either side. One God, one faith&mdash;they
fight for nought. Hell for the
coward, paradise for the brave. Abou
Moslem and Merwan. The earth, on the
spot which had last drunk the red life-blood
of Greek and Persian, now slakes
its fill. Merwan flies with wondrous
steps, but the avenger follows fast. He
first loses his army on the Tigris; himself
dies on the banks of the Nile: there
perished the rule of the Ommiades.</p>

<p>"The hordes of Timour now approach:
their war-song ought to be the chorus of
the spirits of destiny in <em>Manfred</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Our hands contain the hearts of men,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"What a different aspect must this
plain have presented when those sun-burnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
mysterious mounds were living,
teeming, sinning cities; irrigated, cultivated,
protected, safe; fruitful and productive!
And these were barbarous
times; and now, in this our day, peace-congresses,
civilisation, one vast federal
union, liberty, equality;&mdash;a few villages
fortified as castles, a population flying
without a hope of even a death-spot in
peace&mdash;fearful alike of robbers and
rulers, robbed alike by protectors and
enemies, planting the harvest they may
not reap; a government seizing what
the roving Arabs choose to leave; law
known but as oppression; authority a
license to plunder; government a resident
extortioner.</p>

<p>"Too long have we lingered on the
scene. Again the plain is naked, bare,
and lifeless; the sun hovers on the
horizon&mdash;he gilds the desert, licks the
river; the desert breaks his glorious
disc. Slowly, like the light troops
covering a retreat, he collects his rays;
with fondness lights up each hill; warms
with his smile, lighting with unnumbered
tints each peak and crag of hold
desert-throned Singar. Reluctantly he
hovers for a moment on the horizon's
verge, large, fearful, red; then</p>

<p>"Near the convent is a dripping well;
a rough path leads us to it, and its
entrance is shaded by a gigantic tree.
The water is very cold and sweet; the
moisture shed a coolness around, that
made an exquisite retreat. Near it is a
cave which in days of persecution sheltered
securely many of the poor fugitive
Christians. The destruction of most of
the convents about these mountains and
on this plain is imputed to Tamerlane;
but in our own time Sheik Mattie was
attacked by the Koords; its fathers were
slain, beaten, and dispersed; and the
dust of long ages of bishops scattered
to the winds. They still show in the
church the tombs of Mar Halveus and
Abou Faraf, which they say escaped
the observation of the destroyer. The
inscription of one we were able to
decipher; but another resisted even the
efforts of the scholar then resident at
the convent. We in vain tried many
learned men, but the inscription defies
all investigation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Chaldea's seers are good,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"We now made straight for Sheik
Mattie, whose green gorge we could
discover high up the face of the mountain.
The plain was a succession of low
hills all brown with the summer; here
and there a Koord village with its cultivated
fields, cucumbers, and cool melons.
The villages west of the river are
nearly all Christian, but on to-day's
ride we passed two Koordish ones. At
one we halted, and regaled ourselves and
horses on the fruit they pressed on us.</p>

<p>"The old sheik came out, followed by
two men with felts; these were spread
in the cool, and we made kief. He
begged the loan of Zea, (my Albanian
greyhound,) whom he praised beyond
measure for his extreme beauty, to kill
hares. To hear him talk, his complaints
of game, of fields, hares destroyed, &amp;c., I
could have believed myself once more in
England, but that he closed each sentence
with "It is God's will; His will be
done," and such like holy words. His
long, wide, graceful robes also brought
one back to the East, to poetry and to
romance."</p></blockquote>

<p>And here we find less happy accidents
in a traveller's life, which must
not pass unremembered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At first, one of the greatest privations
I experienced in Eastern travel,
and one that half did away with the
pleasure derived from it, was the want of
privacy; and one can fully understand
(as probably centuries have produced but
little change in their habits) the expression
in the Bible, of our Saviour retiring
apart to pray; for, in the East, privacy
is a word unknown. Families live in
one room; men, women, sons, daughters,
sons' wives, &amp;c., and may be said never
to be alone. This at first annoyed me,
but habit is second nature. As soon as
the traveller arrives he has visits; all
the world crowd to see him; the thousand
nameless things one likes to do
after a tedious hot journey must be done
in public. Before you are up they are
there; meals, all, there they are; and
there is nothing for it but to proceed just
as if the privacy was complete....</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, 12th&mdash;I rose as well as
usual: on one side of the tent lay the
Doctor, dead beat; under one flap
which constitutes a separate room, Abdallah
perfectly insensible: the cook lay
behind on a heap of horse-cloths, equally
stricken. I sat down to write in the air:
finding the flies annoyed me, I read, fell
asleep, and remember nothing save a
great sensation of pain and weariness for
two days. It seemed as if a noise awoke
me; it was early morning, and Mr
Layard stood before me. Poor fellow!
he had learned how to treat the fever by
bitter, almost fatal, personal experience;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
and now he dosed us and starved us, till
all but Abdallah were out of danger, at
all events.</p>

<p>"It is curious how soon people of warm
climates,&mdash;or, in fact, I may say,&mdash;all
uneducated people, succumb to sickness.
Hardy fellows, apparently as strong as
iron: when attacked they lie down,
wrap a coat or cloak around them, and
resign themselves to suffer. It would
seem that the mind is alone able to rise
superior to disease: their minds, uncultivated,
by disuse weak, or in perfect
alliance with the body, cease to exist
when its companion falls. In intellectual
man the mind is the last to succumb:
long after the poor weak body has
yielded, the mind holds out like a well-garrisoned
citadel: it refuses all surrender,
and, though the town is taken,
fights bravely till the last."</p></blockquote>

<p>And now one glimpse at Koordistan
and the beautiful and mysterious
Lake Van, which lies hidden in its
deepest recesses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We now journeyed on through
strange regions, where Frank had never
wandered. We saw the Koords as they
are best seen, free in their own magnificent
mountains;&mdash;not "the ass," as the
Turk calls him, "of the plains." Mahomet
Pasha, son of the little standard-bearer,
and Pasha of Mosul was requested
to provide for its defence by the consuls,
and to attempt by better rule the civilisation
of the Arabs. He replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What can I do with people whose
men have no religion, whose women are
without drawers, their horses without
bits, and their camels without halters?'</p>

<p>"Thus we wandered over many miles,
plains spreading between their fat mountains,
splendid in their grandeur; now
amidst pleasant valleys anon over giant
passes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&mdash;&mdash;'Dim retreat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything unreconciled.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"My health after this gradually got
worse: repeated attacks of fever, brought
on probably by my own carelessness,
weakened me so much that I could
scarcely keep up with the party. Riding
was an agony, and, by the carelessness of
my servant, my horses were ruined.
One evening an Abyssinian, one of my
attendants, went so far as to present a
pistol at my head. My poor dear dog,
too, was lost, which perhaps afflicted me
more than most ills which could happen
to myself. At last we passed over a
ridge, and Lake Van lay before us. We
had, perhaps, been the first Europeans
who had performed the journey. The
last and only other of which we have any
record was poor Professor Schultz, who
was murdered by order of Khan Mahmoud
for the baggage he unfortunately
displayed. The Khan received him kindly,
entertained him with hospitality, and
despatched him on his road with a guard
who had their instructions to murder
him on the way. He was an accurate
and capable traveller, a native of Hesse,
and travelling for the French government.</p>

<p>"The morning of the 3d of August saw
us passing up a most lovely valley, the
Vale of Sweet Waters. We had encamped
in it the night before. Leaving
its pretty verdure, we mounted a long
range of sun-burnt hills covered with
sun-dried grass and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">immortelles</i>, whose
immortality must have been sorely tried
on that sun-exposed place. Achieving a
pass, we gained our view of Van. The
scene was worthy of Stanfield in his best
mood. Before us, on the north-east,
brown, quaintly-shaped hills, variegated
with many tints, filled the view of the
far horizon. From this a plain led to the
lake; around it were noble mountains,
snow and cloud clad&mdash;their beauty enhanced
by the supervening water. Saphan
Dagh, with a wreath of mist and cap of
spotless snow, seen across the sea was
imposing&mdash;I might say, perfect.</p>

<p>"The plain on the eastern coast spread
out broad and fair: here verdant meadows,
there masses of fruit-laden trees;
while between the mass wandered the
mountain streams, hastening on to their
homes in the fair bosom of the lake.
Van itself swept round its castle, which
stands on a curious rock that rises abruptly
from the plain; but the lake, indeed,
was the queen of the view&mdash;blue as the far
depth of ocean, yet unlike the ocean&mdash;so
soft, so sweet, so calm was its surface. On
its near coast, bounded by silver sands,
soft and brilliant; while its far west
formed the foot of Nimrod Dagh, on
whose lofty crest are said to be a lake
and a castle....</p>

<p>"The waters of the lake have lately
been analysed, so the curious substance
found floating on its surface, and used
as soap, will be accounted for: it is sold
in the bazaars. At present there are but
three small boats or launches on the
lake, and even these can hardly find trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
enough to remunerate them. Their principal
occupation is carrying passengers
to the towns on the coast."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Layard remained at Lake Van in
order to copy some inscriptions; but
Mr Walpole was induced to penetrate
northward as far as Patnos, where no
European had yet been seen. Here
his enterprise was rewarded by the
view of some magnificent scenery,
and the more important discovery of
some cuneiform, and many ancient
Armenian inscriptions. These were
forwarded by our traveller to Mr
Layard, and will doubtless appear in
his forthcoming work.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But we must
now leave Koordistan, recommending
the perusal of Mr Walpole's chapter
on the Christians of Lake Van, and
their beautiful and mysterious inland
sea, to all who love to picture to
themselves strange lands and wild
adventure. We return by way of
Erzeroum, Trebizond, the shores of
the Black Sea, and Sansoun, to Constantinople;
thence to Latakia; and
here we find ourselves within view of
the mountains of the mysterious
Ansayrii and Ismaylis.</p>

<p>In the title of this work is revived
a subject of very ancient interest.
The Ansayrii, or Nassairi, or Assassins,
are a singularly surviving
relic of the followers of the Old Man
of the Mountain, so celebrated in the
history of the Crusades.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Historians
have fallen into a great mistake in
supposing this Order to have been a
hereditary dynasty, or to have embraced
a nation. Originally it was
simply an Order, like that of the
Templars. Like them the members
wore white garments set off with
crimson, typifying innocence and
blood. The policy of both was to
obtain possession of strong places,
and by terror to keep the surrounding
nations in subjection. The Assassins
succeeded in this object so far as
to dictate their will to several Sultans,
many Viziers, and innumerable
minor authorities. When the Sultan
of the Seljuks sent an ambassador to
the Old Man of the Mountain, demanding
his submission, the following
well-known circumstance took
place:&mdash;"The chief said to one of his
followers, 'Stab thyself!' To another
he said, 'Throw thyself from the
battlements!' Before he had ceased
to speak his disciples had obeyed
him, and lay dead, not only willing
but eager martyrs to their faith.
The chief then turning to the envoy,
said, 'Take what thou hast seen for
thine answer. I am obeyed by
seventy thousand such men as these.'"
The founder of this terrible sect was
Hassan Ben Sahab. He was a "Dai,"
or master-missionary, from the
Secret Lodge established at Cairo,
(about 1004 <small>A.D.</small>), in order to sap
and overthrow the Caliphat of Abbas,
and establish that of the Fatimites.
Hassan gave promise of greatness in
his youth, became a favourite of the
Melekshah, was banished from court
by the intrigues of a rival, and took
refuge at Ispahan. Here he became
initiated in the voluptuous and atheistical
doctrines of the Ismailis, and
was sent to Egypt, to the Caliph
Mostansur, as a preacher and promulgator
of that atrocious creed. He
was banished from the Egyptian
court also, and cast ashore in Syria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
After a variety of adventures in the
course of his travels from Aleppo
through Persia, he at length obtained
possession of the fortress of AlamÅt,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
near Khaswin. Here he remained
for the remainder of his life, never
leaving the castle, and only twice
moving from his own apartment to
the terrace during a period of thirty-eight
years. Here he perfected, in
mystery and deep seclusion, his
diabolical doctrines, and soon sent
"Dais," or missionaries, of his own
into all lands. The secret society of
which he was the head contained
several grades, embracing the initiated,
the aspirant, and the devoted&mdash;mere
executioners or tools of higher
intelligences.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The grand-master
was called Sidna (Sidney) "our
lord;" and more commonly Sheik
el Djebel, the Sheik or Old Man of
the Mountain, because the Order
always possessed themselves of the
castles in mountainous regions in
Irak, Kuhistan, and Syria. The Old
Man, robed in white, resided always
in the mountain fort of AlamÅt.
There he maintained himself against
all the power of the Sultan, until at
length the daggers of his Fedavie, or
devoted followers, freed him from his
most active enemies, and appalled the
others into quiescence. AlamÅt was
now called "the abode of Fortune,"
and all the neighbouring strongholds
submitted to the Ancient of the
Mountain. The Assassins were proscribed
in all civilised communities,
and the dagger and the sword
found constant work on their own
professors. The Assassins, however,
like the Indian Thugs, depraved all
societies, in all sorts of disguises. At
one time the courtiers of a Caliph
being solemnly invoked, with a promise
of pardon and impunity, five
chamberlains stepped forward, and
each showed the dagger, which only
waited an order from the Old Man
to plunge into the heart of any human
being it could reach. By such agency
Hassan kept entire empires in a
state of revolution and carnage.
From his remote fortress he made
his influence felt and feared to the
extreme confines of Khorassan and
Syria. And thence, too, he propagated
the still more infernal engines of his
authority, his catechisms of atheism
and licentiousness&mdash;"Nothing is
true; all things are permitted to the
initiated." Such was the foundation
of his creed.</p>

<p>This villain died tranquilly in his
bed, having survived to the age of
ninety. His spiritual and temporal
power was continued with various
vicissitudes through a long succession
of impostors, the dagger still maintaining
its mysterious and inevitable
agency. The list of the best, and some
of the most powerful, of Oriental
potentates who perished by it, swells,
as the history of the Order proceeds,
to an incredible extent. During all
this time the fundamental maxim of
the creed, which separates the secret
doctrines of the initiated from the
public tenets of the people, was preserved.
These last were (and now
are, according to Mr Walpole) held
to the strictest injunctions of Mahometanism.
The East did not detect
the motive power of the Assassins'
chief: they only saw the poniard
strike those who had offended the
envoy of the invisible Imam, who was
soon to arrive in power and glory, and
to assert his dominion over earth. In
the Crusades, the hand of the Assassins
is traced in the fate of Raymond
of Tripoli&mdash;perhaps in that of the
Marquis of Montferrat&mdash;and in many
meaner instances. At that period
the numbers of people openly professing
the creed is stated by William
of Tyre at sixty thousand; and by
James, Bishop of Alla, at forty thousand.
At this day Mr Walpole estimates
the number of the Ansayrii
at forty thousand fighting men, including
Ismaylis. These numbers
are to be understood, however, in
former times, as well as in the present,
to comprise the whole sect, and
not merely the executioners, who
always formed a very small proportion,
and are now probably extinct.
The Old Man is no longer recognised,
so far as can be ascertained, among
the mountains, (where, as usual in
other parts of Syria, the patriarchal
form prevails;) and the strange creed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
that their ancestors held, together
with a singular recklessness of life,
alone remains to mark their descent.
Concerning this creed we are referred
by Mr Walpole to some discoveries
which he intends to publish in a
future volume. We must confess to
considerable disappointment in the
meagre information that is here afforded
to us on the subject, especially
after our expectations have
been raised by such a preface as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Alone, without means, without
powers to buy or bribe, I have penetrated
a secret, the enigma of ages&mdash;have
dared alone to venture where none
have been&mdash;where the government, with
five hundred soldiers, could not follow;
and, better than all, I have gained esteem
among the race condemned as savages,
and feared as robbers and <small>ASSASSINS</small>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, our author has told
us a good deal that is new and interesting
about the Ansayrii, as will be
seen from our extracts.</p>

<p>The Ismaylis, concerning whose
woman-worship and peculiar habits
such strange stories have been whispered,
live among the southern mountains
of the Ansayrii. They amount
only to five thousand souls, and appear
to be a different tribe, (probably
Arab,) grafted upon them, and gradually,
by superior vigour, possessing
themselves of the strongest places in
the mountains. These people hold a
creed quite distinct from the Ansayrii,
among whom they dwell; and the extraordinary
prayer, or address used by
them seems fully to bear out the long-questioned
assertion of their aphrodisial
worship.</p>

<p>Marco Polo<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was the first to furnish
some curious accounts of the Ansayrii,
and of the discipline and catechism
of the Fedavie: we hope that
Mr Walpole, in his promised volume,
will add to the many vindications
which that brave old traveller has received
from time to time. But at
the sack of AlamÅt, in 1257, all the
Assassins' books (except the Koran)
were burned as impious; and all that
now remains of their doctrines must
be traditional. We have dwelt thus
long on the Ansayrii in order to display
the interest that belongs to that
secluded and mysterious people, and
the importance of any novel intelligence
respecting them. Before we
proceed to illustrate their country
from Mr Walpole's volumes, we must
find space for some account of the
manner in which the initiation of the
Assassins is said to have been performed.
The two great strongholds
of the Order were the castle of AlamÅt
in Irak, and that of Massiat near
Latakia in the Lebanon. These fortresses,
stern and impregnable in
themselves, are said to have been
surrounded with exquisite gardens,
enclosed from all vulgar gaze by
walls of immense height. These
gardens were filled with the most
delicate flowers and delicious fruits.
Streams flowed, and fountains
sparkled brightly, through the grateful
gloom of luxuriant foliage. Bowers
of roses, and porcelain-paved kiosks,
and carpets from the richest looms of
Persia, invited to repose the senses
heavy with luxury. Circassian girls,
bright as the houris of Paradise, served
the happy guests with golden goblets
of Schiraz wine, and glances yet more
intoxicating. The music of harps, and
women's sweetest voices, sent fascination
through the ear as well as eyes.
Everything breathed rapture and sensuality,
intensified by seclusion and
deep calm. The youth, where energy
and courage seemed to qualify him for
the office of <i>fedavie</i>, was invited to the
table of the grand-master, (at Irak,)
or the grand-prior, (at Massiat.) He
was there intoxicated with the
maddening, yet delightful <i>hashishe</i>.
In his insensible state he was transported
to the garden, which, he was
told, was Paradise, and which he was
too ready to take for the scene of
eternal delight, as he revelled in all
the pleasure that Eastern voluptuousness
could devise. He was there lulled
into sleep once more, and then transported
back to the grand-master's
side. As he awoke, numbers of uninitiated
youths were admitted to hear
his account of the Paradise which the
power of the Old Man had permitted
him to taste. And thus tools were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
found and formed for the execution
of the wildest projects. That glimpse
of Paradise for ever haunted the
inflamed imagination of the novices,
and any death appeared welcome that
could restore them to such joys.</p>

<p>Such is the theory of this singular
people, as maintained by Von Hammer,
which it remains for future discoveries&mdash;now
that Mr Walpole has
opened the way for them&mdash;to vindicate
or refute. There are also some
remnants of the Persian tribes of this
people, an account of which, by Mr
Badger, we are informed, is soon to
appear: the Syrians scarcely know of
their existence. The Syrian Ansayrii
amount, as we have said, including
Ismaylis, to about forty thousand
souls: they have always preserved
their seclusion inviolate; setting at
nought the various tyrannies that have
harassed the neighbouring states,
denying the authority of the Sultan,
and blaspheming the Prophet, while
they outwardly conform to his rites.
They occupy the northernmost range
of the Lebanon, from Tortosa and
Latakia, as far as Adana.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Von Hammer's
elaborate and ingenious theory, many
(amongst whom is our author) have
seemed disposed to treat the whole story
of the Assassins, and the Old Man
of the Mountain himself, as myths.
It was, they say, the sort of romance
that the Crusaders would have lent
a ready ear to, and that their troubadours
would have made the most
of. They deny the existence of the
powerful hill fortresses surrounded
by the intoxicating gardens; they
point to the renowned Syrian castle
of El Massiat, whose ruins occupy
a space of only one hundred yards
square, and in whose vaulted stables
there is an inscription purporting
that the castle was "the work of
Roostan the Mameluke."</p>

<p>Mr Walpole, however, does not
enter into any controversy respecting
this strange people. Of the little that
he has confided in his present two
volumes to the public, the following
extracts must be taken as an instalment:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Ansayrii nation&mdash;for such it
is&mdash;being capable of mustering forty
thousand warriors able to bear arms,
is divided into two classes&mdash;sheiks
and people; the sheiks again into two&mdash;Sheiks
or Chiefs of Religion, Sheik el
Maalem, and the temporal Sheiks, or
Sheiks of Government; these being generally
called Sheik el Zullom, or
Sheiks of Oppression. These latter,
though some of them are of good families,
are not so generally: having gained
favour with government, they have received
the appointment. Others there
are, however, whose families have held
it for many generations&mdash;such as Shemseen
Sultan, Sheik Succor, &amp;c. The
sheiks of religion are held as almost
infallible, and the people pay them the
greatest respect. With regard to the
succession, there seems to be no fixed
rule: the elder brother has, however,
rule over the rest; but then I have seen
the son the head of the family while the
father was living.</p>

<p>"The sheik of religion enjoys great
privileges: as a boy he is taught to read
and write; he is marked from his fellows
from very earliest childhood, by a white
handkerchief round his head. Early as
his sense will admit, he is initiated into
the principles of his faith: in this he
is schooled and perfected. Early he is
taught that death, martyrdom, is a glorious
reward; and that, sooner than
divulge one word of his creed, he is to
suffer the case in which his soul is
enshrined to be mangled or tortured in
any way. Frequent instances have been
known where they have defied the
Turks, who have threatened them with
death if they would not divulge, saying,
'Try me; cut my heart out, and see if
anything is within there.' During his
manhood he is strictly to conform to his
faith: this forbids him not only eating
certain things at any time, but eating
at all with any but chiefs of religion;
or eating anything purchased with
unclean money;&mdash;and the higher sheiks
carry this to such an extent that they
will only eat of the produce of their own
grounds; they will not even touch water,
except such as they deem pure and clean.
Then the sheik must exercise the most
unbounded hospitality; and, after death,
the people will build him a tomb, (a
square place, with a dome on the top,)
and he will be revered as a saint.</p>

<p>"The lower classes are initiated into
the principles of their religion, but not
into its more mystical or higher parts:
they are taught to obey their chiefs
without question, without hesitation, and
to give to them abundantly at feasts
and religious ceremonies: above all, even
the uninitiated is to die a thousand
deaths sooner than betray his faith.</p>

<p>"In their houses, which, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
before said, are poor, dirty, and wretched,
they place two small windows over the
door. This is in order that, if a birth
and death occur at the same moment,
the coming and the parting spirit may
not meet. In rooms dedicated to hospitality
several square holes are left, so
that each spirit may come or depart
without meeting another.</p>

<p>"Like the Mahometans, they practise
the rite of circumcision, performing it
at various ages, according to the precocity
of the child. The ceremony is
celebrated, as among the Turks, with
feasting and music. This, they say, is
not a necessary rite, but a custom derived
from ancient times, and they
should be Christians if they did not do it.
This is the same among the Mahometans,
who are not enjoined by their prophet
to do so, but received the rite from
of old.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>"When a candidate is pronounced ready
for initiation, his tarboosh is removed,
and a white cloth wrapped round his head.
He is then conducted into the presence of
the sheiks of religion. The chief proceeds
to deliver a lecture, cautioning him
against ever divulging their great and
solemn secret. 'If you are under the
sword, the rope, or the torture, die, and
smile&mdash;you are blessed.' He then kisses
the earth three times before the chief,
who continues telling him the articles of
their faith. On rising, he teaches him a
sign, and delivers three words to him.
This completes the first lesson.</p>

<p>"At death, the body is washed with
warm soap and water, wrapped in white
cloths, and laid in the tomb. Each person
takes a handful of earth, which is
placed on the body; then upright stones,
one at the feet, one at the head, one in
the middle, are placed. The one in the
middle is necessary. They have the
blood-feud&mdash;the Huck el Dum. In war,
blood is not reckoned; but if one man
kills another of a different tribe, all the
tribe of the slayer pay an equal sum to
the tribe of the slain&mdash;generally one
thousand six hundred piastres, (L.15.)</p>

<p>"In marriage, a certain price is agreed
on. One portion goes to the father,
another to supply dress and things necessary
for the maiden. This will vary much,
according to the wealth of the bridegroom
and the beauty or rank of the
bride. It is generally from two hundred
to seven hundred or a thousand piastres
(L.1, 15s. 6d. to L.9, 10s.) Sometimes a
mare, a cow, or a donkey, merely, is given
for her. The bridegroom has then to
solicit the consent of the <i>hirce</i>, or owner
of the bride's village, who will generally
extort five hundred piastres, or more,
before he will give a permission of marriage.</p>

<p>"The price being settled, and security
given for its payment, the friends of the
bridegroom mount on the top of the house
armed with sticks. The girl's friends
pass her in hastily to avoid their blows.
The bridegroom enters, and beats her
with a stick or back of a sword, so that
she cries: these cries must be heard without.
All then retire, and the marriage
is concluded.</p>

<p>"They are allowed four wives. The
marriage ceremony is simple, and divorce
not permitted. If one of these four wives
die, they are permitted to take another.
Generally, they have little affection for
their wives&mdash;treating them rather as useful
cattle than as rational creatures.
They never teach women the smallest
portion of their faith. They are jealously
excluded from all religious ceremonies;
and, in fact, are utterly denied creed,
prayers, or soul. Many here have told
me that the women themselves believe in
this; and do not, as one would fancy,
murmur at such an exclusive belief.</p>

<p>"The Ansayrii are honest in their
dealings, and none can accuse them of
repudiation or denying a sum they owe....
They regard Mahomet el
Hamyd as the prophet of God, and thus
use the Mussulman confession&mdash;'La illa
ill Allah, Mahomet el Hamyd, Resoul e
nebbi Allah;' but they omit all this
when before Mahometans, saying merely,
'There is no God but God, and Mahomet
is the prophet of God.' Otherwise, they
say, 'There is no God but Ali, and Mahomet
el Hamyd, the Beloved, is the
prophet of God.'</p>

<p>"I do not intend here to enter into
their belief more fully; but it is a most
confused medley&mdash;a unity, a trinity, a
deity. 'These are five; these five are
three; these three are two; these two,
these three, these five&mdash;one.'</p>

<p>"They believe in the transmigration of
souls. Those who in this life do well,
are hospitable, and follow their faith,
become stars; the souls of others return
to the earth, and become Ansayrii again,
until, purified, they fly to rest. The
souls of bad men become Jews, Christians,
and Turks; while the souls of
those who believe not, become pigs and
other beasts. One eve, sitting with a
dear old man, a high sheik&mdash;his boys
were round him&mdash;I said, 'Speak: where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
are the sons of your youth? these are the
children of your old age.'&mdash;'My son,' he
said, looking up, 'is there: nightly he
smiles on me, and invites me to come.'</p>

<p>"They pray five times a day, saying
several prayers each time, turning this
way or that, having no keblah. If a
Christian or Turk sees them at their devotions,
the prayers are of no avail. At
their feasts, they pray in a room closed
and guarded from the sight or ingress of
the uninitiated.</p>

<p>"This will give a general outline of
the faith and customs of the Ansayrii.
My intercourse with them was on the
most friendly footing, and daily a little
was added to my stock of information.
Let me, however, warn the traveller
against entering into argument with
them, or avowing, through the dragoman,
any knowledge of their creed. They are
as ready and prompt to avenge as they
are generous and hospitable to protect.
To destroy one who deceives them on
this point is an imperative duty; and I
firmly believe they would do it though
you took shelter on the divan of the
Sultan. For myself, the risk is passed:
I have gone through the ordeal, and owe
my life several times to perfect accident."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this long extract we shall only
add, that a good deal of additional
light is indirectly thrown upon this
singular people throughout the whole
of the third volume of Mr Walpole's
work. It is the best written, as well
as the most important, of the series;
it abounds in humour, anecdote,
originality, and in no small degree of
curious research.</p>

<p>And now, it only remains for us to
bid our entertaining fellow-traveller
heartily farewell. Although, especially
in the first volume, we have
felt disposed to quarrel with his style
occasionally, we have found his good-humour,
his thoughtful sentiment, and
his reckless wit, at last irresistible.
His very imperfections often prove
his fidelity, and his apparent contradictions
his innate truthfulness. We
commend to him a little more study
of the art of composition, and a good
deal more care; but we shall consider
ourselves fortunate when we meet
with another author of as many faults,
if they are atoned for by as many
merits.</p>

<h2>THE CHAMPIONS OF THE RAIL.</h2>

<p><cite>A History of the English Railway: its Social Relations and Revelations.</cite> By <span class="smcap">John
Francis</span>. 2 vols. London.</p>


<p>A good many years ago, a late
correspondent and writer in this
Magazine, Dr M'Nish of Glasgow,
published a work entitled <cite>The Anatomy
of Drunkenness</cite>. The book was
an excellent one: most perfect in its
portraiture of the different phenomena
which accompany and succeed a debauch;
and in the hands of a regular
tee-totaller, it was undeniably worth
some reams of vapid sermons. The
preacher, who never, we are bound
to believe, had experienced the vinous
or spirituous excitement in his own
person, was enabled from it to hold
forth, with all the unction of reality,
to his terrified audience, upon the
awful effects of intemperance. Old
ladies, who rarely in their lives had
transgressed beyond a second glass of
weak negus at some belated party,
when whist or commerce had been
suggested to while away the weary
hours, listened to the warnings of the
gifted apostle of temperance, and hied
them home in the tremendous conviction
that they had only escaped, by
the merest miracle, the horrors of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delirium tremens</i>. Dyspeptic gentlemen
were rendered wretched, as they
reflected that, for years past, they
had been accustomed to wash down
their evening Finnan haddock, or
moderate board of oysters, with a
pint of Younger's prime ale, or, mayhap,
a screeching tumbler. The
enormity of their offence became
visible to their eyes, and they incontinently
conceived amendment.</p>

<p>But we doubt very much whether
the <cite>Anatomy</cite> would have been pleasant
reading to a gentleman who overnight
had imbibed "not wisely but too well."
How could he bear to be told, not only
of the sensations of the previous evening,
minutely traced through the gradations
of each consecutive decanter,
but of the state of thirst and unnatural
discomfort to which he was presently
a victim? Would it relieve his headach
to assure him that, after swallowing
three bottles of claret, most men
are apt to be out of sorts? Could he,
the sufferer, derive any assuagement
of his pains by knowing&mdash;if he did
not know it already&mdash;that unlimited
brandy and water, however agreeable
during consumption, was clearly prejudicial
to the nerves? Sermons may
come too soon. The sufferer ought
to be allowed at least a day or two to
recover, before his offence is laid
before him in all its huge deformity.
Give him time to be ashamed of himself.
A man's own conscience is his
best accuser; and, unless the vice
be absolutely inherent, or totally
beyond the hope of remedy, his own
misery will be more likely to effect a
cure than any amount of philosophical
dissertations upon its nature.</p>

<p>These thoughts have been irresistibly
suggested to us by a perusal of
the two ponderous tomes of Mr
Francis, entitled, <cite>A History of the
English Railway: its Social Relations
and Revelations</cite>. A more unfortunate
kind of apocalypse could hardly have
been hazarded at the present time.
Most people are tolerably well aware,
without the aid of Mr Francis, of the
changes in social relations which have
been worked by the British railway;
and as for revelations, a good many
would give a trifle to have these
entirely suppressed. We have not
yet arrived at the time when the
history of the "'45" of this century
can be calmly or dispassionately
written. Too many of us, still remanent
here, have burned our fingers,
and too many of our kith and kin
have been sent to exile, in consequence
of that notable enterprise. Since
the standard was last unfurled in the
vale of Glenmutchkin, a considerable
number of the population have been
bitten by the sod, if they did not
literally bite it. That system of
turning over turfs, by the aid of silver
spades and mahogany wheelbarrows,
was more fatal to the peace of families
than the accumulation of any number
of Celtic bagpipers whatever. It
was a grand interment of capital.
Who has forgotten the misery of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>
times, when letters of railway calls
arrived punctually once a quarter?
Two pound ten per share might be a
moderate instalment; but if you were
the unfortunate holder of a hundred
shares, you had better have been
boarded with a vampire. Repudiation,
though a clear Christian duty to yourself
and your family, was utterly
impossible. It mattered not that the
majority of the original committeemen
and directors had bolted; you,
the subscriber, were tied to the stake.
The work was begun, the contracts
opened, and money must be had at all
hazards and sacrifices. You found
yourself in the pitiable situation of an
involuntary philanthropist. Threescore
hulking Irish navvies were daily
fed, liquored, and lodged at your
expense. Your dwindling resources
were torn from you, to make the fortunes
of engineers and contractors.
So long as you had a penny, or a
convertible equivalent, you were
forced to surrender it. Your case
was precisely similar to that of the
Jew incarcerated in the vaults beneath
the royal treasury of King John. One
by one all your teeth were drawn. If
you managed to survive the extraction
of the last grinder, and to behold the
opening of the line, your position was
not one whit improved. Dividend
of course there was none. That
awful and mysterious item of charge,
"working expenses," engulfed nearly
the whole revenue. What was over
went to pay interest on preference
debentures. That gallant body of
men, the directors, laid before you,
with the utmost candour, a state of the
affairs of the company; from which
it appeared that they had exceeded
their borrowing powers by perhaps a
brace of millions, and had raised the
money by interposing their own individual
security. These obligations
you were, of course, expected to
redeem; and an appeal was made to
your finer feelings, urging you to consent
to a further issue of stock!</p>

<p>It is no great consolation to the
men who have suffered more woes
from the railways, than fell to the
lot of the much-enduring Ulysses
from the relentless anger of the
deities, to know that they have rendered
perfect a vast chain of internal
communication throughout the
country. We doubt whether the
Israelites, who built them, took any
especial pride in surveying the pile of
the pyramids. The gentleman in
embarrassed circumstances, who is
pondering over the memory of his
perished capital, is not likely to feel
his heart expand with enthusiasm at
the thought that through his agency,
and that of his fellows, thousands of
bagmen are daily being whirled along
the rails with the velocity of lightning.
He may even be pardoned if,
in the sadness and despondency of
his soul, he should seriously ask himself
what, after all, is the use of this
confounded hurry? Is a man's life
prolonged because he can get along
at the rate of forty or fifty miles
an hour? Is existence to be measured
by locomotion? In that case
Chifney, who passed the best part of
his life in the saddle, ought to have been
considered as a rival to Methuselah,
and a stoker on the Great Western
lives in one week far longer than the
venerable Parr! Is enjoyment multiplied?
That, too, will admit of a
serious doubt. In a railway carriage
you have no fair view of the fresh
aspect of nature: you dash through
the landscape&mdash;supposing that there
is one&mdash;before its leading features are
impressed upon your mind. There
is no time for details, or even for
reflection. You must accommodate
your thought to your pace, otherwise
you are left behind, and see
nothing whatever for at least a
couple of stations. But for the most
part your way lies between embankments
and cuttings, representing
either sections of whinstone, or bare
banks of turf, dotted over with brown
patches, where the engine has effected
arson. Even furze will not willingly
flourish in such an uncomfortable
locality. Then you roar through
tunnels, the passage of which makes
your flesh creep&mdash;for you cannot
divest yourself of a horrid idea that
you may possibly be encountered in
the centre of the darkness by an
opposing engine, and be pounded into
paste by the shock of that terrific
tilt; or that a keystone of the arch
may give way, and the whole train
be buried in the centre of the excavated
mountain. Sensual gratification
there is none. If you do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
condescend to the iniquity of carrying
sandwiches along with you&mdash;in which
case your habiliments are certain to
be grievously defiled with buttered
crumbs&mdash;you are driven by the pangs
of sheer hunger into the refreshment-room
at some station, and find yourself
at the bar of an inferior gin-palace.
Very bad is the pork-pie, for
which you are charged an exorbitant
ransom. Call ye this sherry,
my masters? If it be so, commend
us for the future to Bucellas. The
oranges look well outside, but the
moment you have penetrated the
rind, you find that they have been
boiled and are fozy. Do not indulge
in the vain hope that you may venture
on a glass of anything hot. Hot
enough you will find it with a vengeance;
for, the instant that you receive
the rummer, the bell is sure to ring,
and you must either scald your throat
by gulping down two mouthfuls of
mahogany-water raised to a temperature
which would melt solder, or
consign the prepaid potion to the
leisure of the attendant Hebe. Smoking
is strictly prohibited. Even if
you are alone in a carriage, you cannot
indulge in that luxury without
rendering yourself liable to a fine;
and, if your appetite should overcome
your prudence, and you should
venture to set the law at defiance,
before you have inhaled two whiffs, a
railway guard appears as if by magic
at the window&mdash;for those fellows
have the scent of the vulture, and
can race along the foot-boards as
nimbly as a cat along a gutter&mdash;and
you are ordered to abandon your
Havanna. Under such circumstances,
literature is a poor resource.
You read the <cite>Times</cite> twice over, advertisements
and all, and then sink
into a feverish slumber, from which
you are awakened by a demand from
a ruffian in blue livery, with a glazed
leather belt across his shoulder, for
the exhibition of your ticket. Talk of
the inconvenience of passports abroad!
The Continental system is paradisaical
compared with ours. At length,
after fingering your watch with an
insane desire to accelerate its movement,
you run into the ribs of something,
which resembles the skeleton of
a whale&mdash;the train stops&mdash;and you
know that your journey is at an end.
You select your luggage, after having
undergone the scrutiny of a member
of the police force, who evidently
thinks that he has seen you before
under circumstances of considerable
peculiarity, ensconce yourself in a
cab, and drive off, being favoured at
the gate of the station by a shower
of diminutive pamphlets, purporting
to be poetical tributes to the merits of
Messrs Moses and Hyams. You
have done the distance in twelve
hours, but pleasure you have had
none.</p>

<p>Mr Francis, who is gifted with no
more imagination than an ordinary
tortoise, though he asserts the superiority
of the hare, begins his book
with an exceedingly stupid dissertation
upon the difficulties of ancient
travel. Broken bridges, impassable
quagmires, and ferocious highwaymen
constitute leading features in his picture;
and, as you read him, you marvel,
between your fits of yawning,
what manner of men our ancestors
must have been to brave so many
dangers. Sheer drivel all of it! The
old roads were uncommonly good, and
the bridges kept in splendid repair
from the time they were built by the
Romans. Who ever heard of a quagmire
on a turnpike? As for a casual
encounter with Turpin, Duval, or any
other of the minions of the moon, we
are decidedly of opinion that such
incidents must have added much to
the excitement of the journey. A
stout fellow, well mounted, usually
carried about him both pops and a
cutlass, and, if he was cool and collected,
might very easily square accounts
with the most ardent clerk of
St Nicholas. Does Mr Francis really
suppose that the author of <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite>
likes railway travelling? Not
he. Dearer to his soul is a prancing
prad upon Hounslow Heath than all
the engines that ever whistled along
a line. Mount him upon Black Bess,
arm him with a brace of barkers, and
in the twinkling of an eye there
would be daylight through the carcase
of the Golden Farmer. Is adventure
nothing? Had the road no
joys? Are we to consider the whole
universe worthless, except those black
dots which in the maps represent
cities? Was nature made in vain,
in order that men might hasten from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
town to town, at the tail of a shrieking
engine, regardless of all the glorious
scenery which intervenes? To
our taste, the old mode of travelling&mdash;nay,
the oldest&mdash;was infinitely superior
to the present sickening system.
You rose by times in the
morning; took a substantial breakfast
of beef and ale&mdash;none of your
miserable slops&mdash;and mounted your
horse between your saddle-bags, in
time to hear the lark carolling on his
earliest flight to heaven. Your way
ran through dingle and thicket, along
the banks of rivers, skirting magnificent
parks, rich in the possession of
primeval oaks, under which the deer
lay tranquilly and still. You entered
a village, stopped at the door of the
public-house, and cooled your brow
in the foam of the wholesome home-brewed.
You dined at mid-day, in
some town where the execrable inventions
of Arkwright and Watt were
unknown; where you encountered
only honest, healthy, rosy-cheeked
Christians, who went regularly once
a-week to church, and identified the
devil with the first dissenter&mdash;instead
of meeting gangs of hollow-eyed lean
mechanics, talking radicalism, and
discussing the fundamental points of
the Charter. You moved through
merry England as a man ought to do,
who is both content with his own lot
and can enjoy the happiness of others.
As you saw the sun rising, so you
saw him set. The clouds reddened
in the west&mdash;you heard the sweet
carol of the thrush from the coppice,
and lingered to catch the melody.
The shades of evening grew deeper.
The glow-worms lit their tiny lanterns
on the bank, the owl flitted
past with noiseless wing, the village
candles began to appear in the distance;
and as you dismounted at the
door of your humble inn, and surrendered
your weary beast to the hands
of the careful hostler, you felt that
you were the richer by a day spent
in the fresh air and gladsome sunshine,
and made happy by all the
sounds and sights which are dear to
the heart of man.</p>

<p>But this was solitary travelling,
and might not suit every one. Well&mdash;if
you were a little fellow, deficient
in pluck, and sorely afraid of robbers,
you might have company for
the asking. At every large inn on the
road there were at least a dozen travellers
who, for the sake of security,
agreed to journey in company. Was
that no fun? Have you anything
like it in your modern railways?
Just compare your own experiences
of a rocket-flight along the Great
Western with Chaucer's delineation
of his Canterbury pilgrimage, and
you will see what you have lost.
Nice sort of tales you would elicit
either from that beetle-browed Bradford
Free-Trader, evidently a dealer
in devil's-dust, who is your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>
in the railway carriage; or from that
singular specimen of a nun who is
ogling you deliberately on the left!
Can you associate the story of Palamon
and Arcite&mdash;can you connect
anything which is noble, lofty, inspiriting,
humane, or gentle, with a
journey made in an express train?
If not, so much the worse for the
present times. Doubtless you may
hear something about Thompson or
Bright, but we may be excused if we
prefer the mention of the earlier
heroes. Also, you may pick up information
touching the price of calicoes,
or the value of stocks, or the
amount of exports of cotton twist&mdash;and
we wish you much good of all
that you get. But, O dear, is that
travelling? Would you like to go
from London to Ispahan in such company?
How long do you think you
could stand it? And yet this is the
improved system of locomotion for
which we are told to be thankful, and
in honour of which such weariful
volumes as those of Mr Francis are
written.</p>

<p>"But, mercy on us!" we hear Mr
Francis or some of his backers exclaim&mdash;"is
it nothing that commercial
gentlemen can now make four
trips a-day between Manchester and
Liverpool, and do a stroke of business
on each occasion?" We reply, that
it would be better for the said commercial
gentlemen, both here and
hereafter, if they would content themselves
with a more moderate pursuit
of Mammon. Happiness in this life
does not depend upon the amount of
sales effected. The assistant in the
London grocer's shop, who daily ties
up a thousand packages of tea and
sugar, is not greatly to be envied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
beyond his brother in the country, who
twists the twine around fifty. We
have an intense respect for work
while kept within wholesome limits;
but we cannot regard the man whose
sole pursuit is grubbing after gold as
otherwise than an ignominious slave.
The railways are in one sense excellent
things. You can get from point
to point, if necessity requires it, much
sooner than before, at less cost, and
perhaps with less inconvenience. But
there the advantage ends. There is
no pleasure in them; and, compared
with former methods of locomotion,
they are decidedly less healthy and
less instructive. We decry them not.
We only wish to stop the babbling of
the blockheads who would have us to
believe that, until the steam-engine
was invented, this earth was an unendurable
waste, a wilderness of barbarians,
and an unfit residence for
civilised and enlightened man. Would
the genius either of Shakspeare or
Newton have been greater had they
known of the rails? Would the splendour
of the reign of Elizabeth have
been heightened had Stephenson then
existed?</p>

<p>The admiration of Mr Francis for
the railway system is so intense as to
be purely ludicrous. He considers
every man connected with its development&mdash;whether
as engineer, contractor,
or director&mdash;as a positive
public hero; and this work of his
seems intended as a kind of Iliad, to
chronicle their several achievements.
Since we last met, Mr Francis has
been hard at work upon his style.
Formerly he went along, pleasantly
enough, without any great effort:
now he is not satisfied unless he can
eclipse Mr Macaulay. He has read
the <cite>History of England</cite> to some purpose.
Fascinated by the brilliancy
of the sketches which the accomplished
historian has drawn of the
statesmen of the age of William of
Orange, Mr Francis thinks he will
not do justice to his subject unless he
adopts a similar mode of handling.
Unfortunately he has no statesmen
to celebrate. But he can do quite as
well. There are surveyors and contractors
by the score, whose portraits
in his eyes are just as interesting.
Accordingly, we have a repetition of
the old scene in the play. A voice
without is heard calling, "Francis!"
To which summons Francis incontinently
replieth, "Anon, anon, sir!"
and then&mdash;"Enter Poins, Peto, Gadshill,
and the rest." No loftier apparition
ever comes upon the stage;
but we are warned that, in surveying
these, we look upon individuals destined
in all coming time to occupy a
lofty niche in British history. Thus,
to quote at random from the index,
we have the following entries&mdash;"Richard
Creed ... his services
and character." "Who may this Mr
Richard Creed be?" says the unconscious
reader; "we never heard of
him before!" "Fool!" quoth Francis,
"he was <span class="smcap">the Secretary of
the London and Birmingham
line</span>! 'On his honesty and integrity,'
said Mr Glyn on one occasion emphatically,
'I pin my faith, and you may
pin yours also!'" And he adds, referring
to an occasion which must
have been exceedingly gratifying to
the feelings of the recipient&mdash;"The
testimonial to this gentleman, in 1844,
was worthy the munificence of the
givers. It is not often that a cheque
for two thousand one hundred guineas
accompanies an expression of opinion,
or that the rich man's praise fructifies
into a service of plate." As we contemplate
our unadorned sideboard,
we acknowledge the truth of this remark;
still, we hesitate to exalt Mr
Creed to the rank of a hero. Then
we light on "Undertakings of Thomas
Brassey.... Anecdote concerning
him." Mr Brassey is a contractor,
eminent no doubt; but so, in his own
age, must have been the Roman gentleman
who undertook the construction
of the Cloaca Maxima, though his name
has unfortunately perished. Then appears
"Henry Booth.... His services."
We trust they were properly
acknowledged. Then, "Personal
sketches of Mr Locke and Mr Chaplin."
We are greatly edified by the <em>silhouettes</em>.
"Personal sketch of Samuel Morton
Peto." We shall try, if possible, not
to forget him. Much as Mr Francis
has done to perpetuate the memory
of these great men, it is plain that his
powers have been cramped with the
space of two thick octavo volumes.
In order to make his Iliad perfect, we
ought to have had a catalogue of the
chiefs of the navvies. But we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
rest satisfied with the acute remark
of Herder, that "the burden of the
song is infinite, but the powers of the
human voice are finite." Mr Francis
has done what he can. Creed and
Brassey&mdash;Brunel and Locke&mdash;Chaplin,
Peto, and Vignolles, live within
his inspired volumes; and we beg to
congratulate them on account of that
assured immortalisation. They are
the salt of the earth. The compilers of
traffic-tables have disappeared&mdash;the
old standing witnesses before committees
of the House of Commons are
dumb&mdash;the young engineering gentlemen,
who could do anything they
pleased in the way of levelling mountains,
are amusing themselves in California
or elsewhere&mdash;even the mighty
counsel, the holders of a hundred
briefs, for which, for the most part,
they rendered but indifferent service,
are unsung. But the others live. In
the British Valhalla they are assured
of an adequate niche, thanks to Mr
Francis, who, as Captain Dangerfield
says, is ready to stake his reputation
that they are the only men worthy
of record in such an enlightened age
as our own.</p>

<p>No&mdash;we are wrong. The man of
all others to be deeply venerated is
"George Carr Glyn, Esq., Chairman
of the London and North-Western
Railway," to whom these volumes are
respectfully dedicated. Of Mr Glyn's
career as a statesman we know absolutely
nothing. We are not even
aware to what section of politicians
he belongs, so utter is our ignorance
of his fame. As we read the pages
of Francis, and encountered the continual
eulogiums heaped upon this
gentleman, we felt remarkably uncomfortable.
We could not divest
ourselves of the notion that we had
been asleep for some quarter of a century,
and had therefore missed the
opportunity of witnessing the appearance
of a new and most brilliant star
in the political horizon. About Mr
Glyn, Francis has no manner of
doubt. He is not only the most
sagacious, but the most clever personage
extant, for every purpose
which can smooth railway difficulties.
He is the Ulysses of his line, and can
rap Thersites on the sconce, if that
cynical fiend should insist upon an
awkward question. We really and
unaffectedly ask pardon of Mr Glyn,
if we mistake him through his eulogist.
We have no other means of
knowing him; and therefore he must
settle the correctness of the following
sketch with Mr Francis, who appears
as the voluntary artist. If the drawing
is to the mind of Mr Glyn, and if
it meets his ideas of ethics, we have
nothing in the world to say against
it, having no interest whatever in the
line over which he presides. Hear
Francis: "The proper place to see
Mr Glyn is as chairman in that noble
room, where, with an earnest multitude
around him, with the representative
of every class and caste before
him&mdash;with Jew and Gentile ready to
carp at and criticise his statements&mdash;he
yet moves them at his pleasure,
and leads them at his will. And perhaps
the ascendency of one man over
many is seldom <em>more agreeably seen</em>
than when, standing before a huge expectant
audience, he enlivens the platitudes
of one with some light epigrammatic
touch, answers another with
a clear tabular statement, <em>or replies
to a third with some fallacy so like a
fact</em> that the recipient sits contentedly
down, about as wise as he was before."
This is, to say the least of it,
an equivocal sort of panegyric. We
all know what is implied by the term
"fallacies" in railway matters, and
some of us have suffered in consequence.
According to our view, this
interchange of fallacies between directors
and shareholders is a custom
by no means laudable, or to be held
in especial repute. In pure matters
of business, the less frequently fallacies
are resorted to, the better. They are
apt, in the long run, to find their way
into the balance-sheet&mdash;until, as we
have seen in some notorious instances,
the assumed fact of a clear balance, to
be applied by way of dividend, turns
out also to be a fallacy. In the case
before us, we are willing to believe
that Mr Francis is altogether mistaken,
and that the statements of Mr
Glyn, made in his official capacity,
which appeared to the blundering reporter
to be fallacies, were in reality
stern truths. But what sort of estimate
must we form of Mr Francis'
moral perception, when we find him
selecting such a trait as the subject
of especial commendation? He has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
however, like most other great men,
large sympathies. He does battle in
behalf of Mr Hudson with considerable
energy; though, after all, taking
his conclusions as legitimate, his defence
simply resolves itself into this&mdash;that
Mr Hudson's conduct was not
more blamable than that of others.
So be it. We never joined in the
wholesale censure directed against
the quondam railway monarch, because
we knew that the whole tone of
the morals of society had been poisoned
by the villanous system engendered
by railway speculation;
and because we saw that many of his
accusers, if their own conduct had
been sifted, might have been arraigned
equally with him at the bar of public
opinion. Therefore we have no
desire to interfere with the operations
of Mr Francis, when he appears with
his pot of whitewash. Nay, we wish
that the implement were more roomy
than it is, and the contents of less
questionable purity&mdash;for assuredly he
has a large surface of wall to cover,
if he sets himself seriously to the task
of obliterating the traces of past iniquity.</p>

<p>The reader, however, must not
suppose that Mr Francis sees nothing
to condemn, or that he has not at
command thunderbolts of wrath to
launch at the heads of offenders.
According to him, the most painful
feature of the railway system was the
rapacity of the owners of the soil in
driving hard bargains for their land.
As this is a charge which has often
been made by men more competent
to form an opinion upon any subject
than the gentleman whose work we
are now reviewing, we shall condescend
to notice it. Let us premise
however, that, in this matter, the
howl is distinctly traceable to the
harpies who inveigled the public to
join their nefarious schemes, and to
advance their capital on the assurance
of enormous dividends.</p>

<p>After referring to the negotiations
made with landowners by the promoters
of the London and Birmingham
line, Mr Francis comments as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These things are written with pain,
for they display a low tone of moral feeling
in that class which, by virtue of inheritance,
of birth, and blood, should
possess a high and chivalrous sense of
honour. The writer is far from wishing
to blame those who honestly opposed the
rail. The conscientious feeling which
prompts a man, even in an unwise action,
if mistaken, is at least respectable. There
is much to palliate the honest opposition
of the landowner. Scenes and spots
which are replete with associations of
great men and great deeds cannot be
pecuniarily paid for. Sites which bear
memories more selfish, yet not less real,
have no market value. Homes in which
boyhood, manhood, and age have been
passed, carry recollections which are
almost hallowed. Such places cannot
be bought and sold; nor are the various
prejudices which cling to the country to
be overlooked. If the nobleman disliked
the destruction of his fine old English
park, the yeoman deplored the desecration
of his homestead. The one bore its
splendid remembrances, the other its
affectionate recollections. If the peer
hallowed the former for the sake of its
royal visits, the farmer cherished the
latter for the sake of those who had tilled
the land before him. There are fancy
spots in this our beautiful England which
it would pain the most indifferent to destroy;
what then must be the feelings of
those who have lived, and only wish to
die there?</p>

<p>"It is the trafficker in sympathies, it
is the dealer in haunts and homes, at
whom the finger of scorn should be
pointed. It is the trader in touching
recollections, only to be soothed by gold,
that should be denounced. It is the peer
who made the historic memories of his
mansion a plea for replenishing an impoverished
estate; it is the farmer who
made the sacred associations of home an
excuse for receiving treble its value; it is
the country gentleman who made his opposition
the lever by which he procured
the money from the proprietors' pockets,
who should be shamed. And a double
portion of ignominy must rest upon these,
when it is remembered that the money
thus immorally obtained is a constant
tax on the pleasures of the artisan, on
the work of the manufacturer, and on
the wages of the railway official."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Francis, it is evident, is fighting
hard for his service of plate; but
we doubt much whether he will get
it. He evidently considers the foregoing
passage as a specimen of splendid
writing. He is mistaken. It is
nothing better than unadulterated
drivel. Let us try to extricate, if we
can, his argument from this heap of
verbiage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span></p>

<p>He admits that associations ought
to be respected, but he denies that
they ought to have been paid for.
What does he mean by this? By
whom were the said associations to be
respected? By the projectors of the
railway companies? Hardly: for
those very sympathising gentlemen
were precisely the persons who insisted
upon running their rails right
through park and cottage, and who
would have prostrated without remorse
the Temple of Jerusalem or the
Coliseum, had either edifice stood in
their way. What, then, was the
value of that respect? Precisely
the worth of the tear which stood in
the eye of the tender-hearted surveyor.
What was the operation of
that respect? Not to spare, but if
possible to destroy.</p>

<p>In a word, Mr Francis maintains
that the railway companies ought to
have had their own way in everything,
and to have got possession of
the land at the lowest conceivable
prices. He thinks that, because gentlemen
whose property was threatened
with invasion, whose privacy it was
purposed to destroy, and whose homes
were to be rendered untenantable,
demanded a high price from the joint-stock
trading companies, as an equivalent
for the surrender of such privileges,
they manifested a "low tone
of moral feeling." In fact, so far as
we can gather from his language, he
puts no value whatever, in a pecuniary
sense, upon the associations
which he admits to be entitled to
respect; and hardly any, if any, upon
the score of amenity. He is anything
but an Evelyn. An oak, in his eyes,
is merely a piece of standing timber
to be measured, valued, and paid for
according to the current price in the
dockyards. The land&mdash;no matter of
what kind&mdash;is to be estimated according
to the amount of its yearly return,
and handed over without farther
question to the enterprising company
which demands it. Perhaps Mr
Francis may remember a certain passage
in sacred history, narrating the
particulars of a proposed transfer of
ground&mdash;the parties being King Ahab
on the one hand, and Naboth the
Jezreelite on the other? If not, we
recommend it to his attention, assuring
him that he will find it to contain
a very important lesson touching the
rights of property. His present argument,
if it is worth anything, would
go far to vindicate Ahab. He wanted
the other man's vineyard because it
lay contiguous to his house, and he
offered to give him in exchange a
better vineyard for it, or an equivalent
in money. According to the view
maintained by Mr Francis, Naboth
was not justified in refusing the offer.</p>

<p>But let us look into this matter a
little more closely. On the one hand
there is the owner of a property which
has been transmitted through a long
line of ancestors, and which is now to
be intersected and cut up by a projected
line of railway. On the other
hand there is the company, which
cannot progress a step until they have
possession of the land. Now let us
see what is the nature, and what are
the objects of this company. It will
not do for Mr Francis or any one else
to babble about public advantages,
arising from more direct communication
between cities or towns of importance.
Public advantage may be
taken for granted as a result, but
upon pure considerations of public
advantage no railway whatever was
undertaken. It is the commercial
speculation of a private company. No
man ever took a share in any railway
from motives of disinterested philanthropy.
He took them because he
expected to make a profit by them, to
hold them as a safe investment, or
finally to sell them for a larger sum
than he paid. A condition, and the
main one, of the existence of the railway
is the possession of the land, and
at this point proprietors and speculators
join issue. The former do not
want the railway. Their wish is to
preserve their property undissevered,
and to be spared from the spectacle
of engines roaring by at all hours of
the day and night close to the bottom
of the lawn. They very naturally
think it a monstrous hardship that the
rights of private property should be
invaded by private individuals, even
though acting upon an incorporated
semblance, who are simply seeking
their own profit; and they argue
that, if the railway was required for
public purposes, the government was
the proper party to have undertaken
its construction. But as, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
existing law, they are liable to be
dragged, session after session, into a
ruinous expense to oppose the demands
of the capitalists, they wisely
determine to make the best arrangement
they can, and at all events to
secure a full remuneration for the
sacrifice. So the Squire, finding that
the law is so conceived and modified
that any one individual who is possessed
of landed property may be
compelled to surrender it at the
demand of a hundred leagued capitalists,
makes a virtue of necessity, and
demands a sum corresponding in some
degree to the extent of the extorted
sacrifice: whereupon the promoters
of the railway instantly raise such a
howl that you would think somebody
was trying to rob <em>them</em>, or to take
<em>their</em> property by force&mdash;the case being
notoriously the reverse.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Squire demands
more from the railway company, as
compensation for his land, than he
could calculate on receiving from a
neighbouring proprietor at an ordinary
sale. And on what principle,
in the majority of cases, does he
base his calculation of value? Strictly
upon that adopted by the projectors
of the line. For instance, a prospectus
of a railway is put out,
announcing that, after the most
careful consideration of district
traffic, &amp;c., the clear dividend, after
clearing all expenses, must be fifteen
per cent per annum to the proprietors.
That is the statement of the projectors.
Well, then, if such are the
prospects of the concern, is it unreasonable
that the land, which must
be taken for its construction, and
which is, in fact, to form the railway,
should be valued, less on account of
its productiveness, than on account
of its adaptation for the peculiar
purpose for which it is required?
Why is an acre in the centre of a
town a hundred times more valuable
than an acre in a rural district?
Simply because it is required for
building, and the value of the land
rises in just correspondence to the
demand. The subsequent failure or
diminution of the railway dividends
cannot be made a just article of
dittay against the landed proprietors.
Fifteen per cent, or ten, as the case
might be, was the amount of dividend
which the promoters undertook
to prove, to the satisfaction of Parliament
and the public, as their reasonable
expectation. It was part of
their case always, and very often
the most important part; and if they
chose so to commit themselves, they
were bound to pay accordingly. Just
conceive a body of men addressing
an urban proprietor of land, upon
which no houses were yet built, in
the following terms:&mdash;"Sir, we perceive
you have an acre and a half
of land which would be very convenient
for our purpose. We propose
to build a street of houses upon it,
and a hotel, from the rents of which
we expect to draw fifteen per cent
yearly. At present your land yields
you little or nothing, and therefore
we wish you to dispose of it at its
present value. Let us say that just
now it is worth to you five pounds
a-year: we shall buy it from you
at five-and-twenty years' purchase!"
We leave to the imagination of the
reader the exact terms in which the
proprietor would assuredly reply to
the propounders of this reasonable
request. And yet, where is the difference
between the cases? The
railway projector tells the landed
proprietor that he desires to have
his property for the purpose of
securing fifteen per cent for his
own money: the landed proprietor
tells him that he may have the property
at a rate corresponding to the
advantage which he anticipates. Can
anything be fairer? If Mr Francis
understood even the simplest elements
of political economy&mdash;an
amount of mental comprehension of
which we believe him to be wholly
incapable&mdash;he ought to know that
demand and supply are the leading
conditions of price. If there is only
one salmon in the London market,
it will sell, as it has done before now,
at the rate of a-guinea per pound,
and it would be obviously unfair to
charge the fishmonger with being
actuated by "a low tone of moral
feeling." He coerces no customer:
he simply states his price, and if
no one chooses to buy, no one has a
right to complain. Our friend Francis
seems to labour under the hallucination
that everything required for a
railway ought to be furnished at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
prime cost. That the promoters expect
fifteen percent is nothing. Nay,
even the free-trading rule of selling
in the dearest and buying in the
cheapest market is to be suspended
for their behoof. The seller is to
have no option: he must be cheap
to them, else he is a moral monster.
If, however, the judicious panegyrist
of Mr Carr Glyn does not carry his
principles quite so far, he lays
himself open to the charge of most
monstrous inconsistency. During the
prevalence of the railway mania, all
commodities requisite for their construction
rose greatly in value. From
iron to railway sleepers&mdash;in wood,
metal, and everything connected with
the making of the lines&mdash;there was
an enormous enhancement of price.
And why? On account of the demand.
Was the soil on which that
iron and wood was to be laid&mdash;the
absolute foundation of the railway
itself&mdash;to be paid for at a meaner
rate? Mr Francis seems to think
so; and we cannot help honouring
him for the candid expression of his
opinions, even while we regret the
conglomeration of ideas which gave
them birth. We are afraid that he
has been talked over by some of his
acute acquaintances. It is the fashion
at railway meetings to attribute all
disasters to some other cause than
the mismanagement of the directors;
and we daresay that Mr Francis has
been fully indoctrinated with such
opinions. It is not agreeable to meet
shareholders with a confession of
dwindled dividend. But when imperious
circumstances render such a
course inevitable, it is convenient to
be prepared with some "fallacy"
which may help to account for the
fact, and to stifle too curious investigation.
The readiest scapegoat is the
landowner. All accounting with him
is past and gone, yet he still can be
made to bear the blame for a vast
amount of reckless prodigality. He
is not there to speak for himself&mdash;he
has no connection with the company.
Therefore, whenever failure must be
acknowledged, the onus is cast upon
him. Railway orators and railway
writers alike conceal the real cause
of the disaster, and combine to cast
discredit and aspersion upon the
gentry of England.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the system of
railway management in this country
has been, from the beginning to the
end, decidedly bad. Each line, as
it came into existence, was fostered
by quackery and falsehood. The
most extravagant representations
were used to secure the adhesion
of shareholders, and to procure the
public support. Rival lines fought
each other before the committees
with a desperation worthy of the
cats of Kilkenny, and enormous
expenses and law charges were incurred
at the very commencement.
No economy whatever was used in
the engineering, and no check placed
on the engineers. In those days,
indeed, an engineer of established
reputation was a kind of demigod,
whose doctrine, or, at all events,
whose charges, it was sinful to
challenge. But engineers have their
ambition. They like viaducts which
will be talked of and admired as
splendid achievements of mechanical
skill; and the most virtuous of the
tribe cannot resist the temptation
of a tunnel. Such tastes are natural,
but they are fearfully expensive in
their indulgence, as the shareholders
know to their cost. The remuneration
of these gentlemen was monstrous.
In the course of a few years most of
them realised large fortunes, which is
more than can be said for the majority
of the men who paid them. So was
it with the contractors. Mr Francis
tells us of many, "who, beginning life
as navigators, have become contractors;
who, having saved money, have
become 'gangers,' realised capital
and formed contracts, first for thousands,
and then for hundreds of
thousands. These are almost a caste
by themselves. They make fortunes,
and purchase landed estates. Many
a fine property has passed from
some improvident possessor to a
railway labourer; and some of the
most beautiful country seats in England
belong to men who trundled
the barrow, who delved with the
spade, who smote with the pick-axe,
and blasted the rock." With such
statements before us, it is not difficult
to see how the money went.
Alas for the shareholders! Poor
geese! they little thought how many
were to have a pluck at their pinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span></p>

<p>Industry, we freely admit, ought to
have its reward; but rewards such as
these are beyond the reach of pure
industry, as we used formerly to
understand the term. These revelations
may, however, be of use as
indicating the direction in which a
great part of the money has gone.
We accept them as such, and as illustrations
of that profound economy
which was practised by the different
boards of railway direction throughout
the kingdom. Mr Francis, in his
laudatory sketches of his favourite heroes,
usually takes care to tell us that
they are "sprung from the ranks of the
people." Of course they are. Where
else were they to spring from? Does
Mr Francis suppose it to be a popular
article of belief that they emerged
from the bowels of a steam-engine?
What he means, however, is plain
enough. Judging from the whole
tenor of his book, we take him to
be one of those jaundiced persons
who, without any intelligible reason
beyond class prejudice, are filled
with bile and rancour against the
aristocracy, and who worship at the
shrine of money. He grudges every
farthing that the railway companies
were compelled to pay for land; he
bows down in reverence before the
princely fortunes of the contractors.
Every man to his own taste. We
cannot truthfully assert that we
admire the selection of his idols.</p>

<p>But what is this? We have just
lighted upon a passage which compels
us, in spite of ourselves, to suspect
that our Francis is, at least, a bit of
a repudiator, and that he would
regard with no unfavourable eye
another pluck at the shareholders.
Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The assertion that land and compensation
on the line to which Mr
Robert Stephenson was engineer, which
was estimated at £250,000, amounted to
£750,000, appears to call for some additional
remark; <em>and the question which is
now proposed is, how far the right is with
the railroads to demand, and the passengers
to pay an increased fare, in consequence
of bargains which, unjust in
principle, ought never to have been allowed?</em>
It is now a historic fact that every line
in England has cost more than it ought.
That in some&mdash;where, too, the directors
were business men&mdash;large sums were
improperly paid for land, for compensation,
for consequential damages, for fancy
prospects, and other unjust demands
under various names. These sums being
immorally obtained, <em>is it right that the public
should pay the interest on them</em>? Is it
just that the working man should forego
his trifling luxury to meet them? Is it
fair that the artisan should be deprived
of his occasional trip, or that the frequenter
of the rail should pay an additional
tax?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Is it fair that anybody should pay
anything at all for travelling on the
railways? That is the question which
must finally be considered, if Mr
Francis' preliminary questions are to
be entertained. Because some part
of the capital of the shareholders may
have been needlessly expended, they
ought in this view to receive a less
amount of interest for the remainder!
The silliness of the above passage is
so supreme&mdash;the ignorance which it
displays of the first rules of law and
equity, regarding property, is so profound,
that it is hardly worth while
exposing it. It betrays an obliquity
of intellect of which we had not previously
suspected even Mr Francis.
Pray observe the exquisite serenity
with which this important personage
opens his case: "The question which
is now proposed!" Proposed&mdash;and
for whose consideration? Not surely
for that of the Legislature, for the
Legislature has already pronounced
judgment. Are the public to take
the matter in hand, and decide on the
tables of rates? It would seem so.
In that case, we might indeed calculate
upon travelling cheap, provided
the rails were not shut up. But the
whole of his remarks are as practically
absurd as they are mischievous
in doctrine. What right has Jack,
Tom, or Harry to question the cost
of his conveyance? Are there not,
in all conscience, competing lines
enough, independent altogether of Parliamentary
regulations, to secure the
public against being overcharged on
the railways? On what authority does
Mr Francis assume that a single acre
of the land was paid for at an unjust
rate? Mr Robert Stephenson's estimate,
we take it, has not the authority
of gospel. No engineer's estimate
has. Their margin is always
a large one; and it almost never happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
that, when the works are completed,
their actual cost is found to
correspond with the hypothetical
calculation. But the truth is, that
the value paid for the land taken by
railways is the only item of expense
which cannot be justly challenged.
The reason is plain. A railway company
has in the first instance to
prove the preamble of its bill&mdash;that
is, it must show to the satisfaction of
the Legislature that the construction
of the work will be attended with
public and local advantages. The
settlement of the money question,
regarding the value of the land, is
reserved for the legal tribunals of the
country. To complain of the verdicts
given is to impugn the course of
justice, and to cast discredit on the
system of jury trial. Very wisely
was it determined that such questions
should be so adjudicated, because no
reasonable ground of complaint can
be left to either party. The decision
as to the value of the land, and the
amount of compensation which is
due, is taken from the hands both of
Ahab and Naboth, and their respective
engineers and valuators, and intrusted
to neutral parties, whose duty
it is to see fair play between them.</p>

<p>We have done with this book. It
has greatly disappointed us in every
respect. As a repertory of facts, or
as a history of the railways, it is
ill-arranged, meagre, and stupid;
and the sketches which it contains
are so absurdly conceived, and so
clumsily executed, that they entirely
fail to enliven the general dulness of
the volumes. At the very point
which might have been rendered
most interesting in the hands of an
able and well-instructed writer&mdash;the
period of the great mania&mdash;Mr
Francis fails. His pen is not adequate
to the task of depicting the rapid
occurrences of the day, or the fearful
whirl which then agitated the public
mind. In short, he is insufferably
prosy throughout the first four acts
of his drama, and makes a lamentable
break-down at the catastrophe. His
work will fail to please any portion of
the public, except the heroes whose
praises he has sung. He has given
them sugar, indeed; but, after all, it is
a sanded article. We hope they will
combine to buy up the edition, and
thus fulfil the prophecy of Shakspeare&mdash;"Nay,
but hark you, Francis:
for the sugar thou gavest me&mdash;'twas
a pennyworth, was't not?" "O Lord,
sir! I would it had been two." "I
will give thee for it a thousand pound:
ask me when thou wilt, and thou
shalt have it." "Anon, anon, sir!"</p>

The mere physical pleasure of the upper voyage has been thus described&mdash;"No
words can convey an idea of the beauty and delightfulness of tropical weather, at
least while any breeze from the north is blowing. There is a pleasure in the very
act of breathing&mdash;a voluptuous consciousness that existence is a blessed thing: the
pulse beats high, but calmly; the eye feels expanded; the chest heaves pleasureably,
as if air was a delicious draught to thirsty lungs; and the mind takes its colouring
and character from sensation. No thought of melancholy ever darkens over us&mdash;no
painful sense of isolation or of loneliness, as day after day we pass on through silent
deserts, upon the silent and solemn river. One seems, as it were, removed into
another state of existence; and all the strifes and struggles of that from which we
have emerged seem to fade, softened into indistinctness. This is what Homer and
Alfred Tennyson knew that the lotus-eaters felt when they tasted of the mysterious
tree of this country, and became weary of their wanderings:&mdash;

<span class="i4">'&mdash;&mdash;To him the gushing of the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far away, did seem to mourn and rave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On alien shores: and, if his fellow spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was thin, as voices from the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep asleep he seemed, yet all awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music in his ears his beating heart did make.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the day, with all the tyranny of its sunshine and its innumerable insects, be
enjoyable in the tropics, the night is still more so. The stars shine out with diamond
brilliancy, and appear as large as if seen through a telescope. Their changing
colours, the wake of light they cast upon the water, the distinctness of the milky
way, and the splendour, above all, of the evening star, give one the impression of being
under a different firmament from that to which we have been accustomed; then
the cool delicious airs, with all the strange and stilly sounds they bear from the
desert and the forest; the delicate scents they scatter, and the languid breathings
with which they make our large white sails appear to pant, as they heave and languish
softly over the water."&mdash;(<cite>The Crescent and the Cross</cite>, vol. i. p. 210.)

or Sinai to Jerusalem, is performed in the same manner as it was in the days when
Eothen, Dr Robinson, and Lord Castlereagh described it. The only difference occurs
in the route between Cairo and Suez, which is now performed on wheels in about
twelve hours, and, in the course of eighteen months, is expected to be easily accomplished
in two hours and a half by railway.</p></div>

upon any subject in which he might anticipate the works of other travellers. For
this reason he passes lightly over this interesting tour in the mountains of Koordistan,
and only (to our regret) alludes <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i> to a tribe of <em>pastoral</em> Jews, whom he
and Mr Layard met on these mountains, following the spring (as the snows receding
left fresh herbage for their flocks) up the mountains. When we consider how rarely
pastoral Jews are met with, and that this was the very land wherein the lost ten
tribes disappeared, and, moreover, that the elders of these people spoke the Chaldean
tongue, we are much disappointed to hear no more of them.</p></div>

in his twenty-four books, has not attempted to penetrate it. And Gibbon, notwithstanding
his acknowledged pleasure in painting scenes of blood, has treated the Order
of Assassins very superficially. Marco Polo is, as usual, the most entertaining of
authorities, as far as he goes; but it remained for Joseph Von Hammer to explore the
faint vestiges of their strange story with vast and patient research. He has thrown
together the results of his labours in a small volume, of great interest.</p></div>
